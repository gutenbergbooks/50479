<i>TO THE READER</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>DEAR SIR OR MADAM:&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Good wine needs no bush, but a collection of mixed vintages
does.  And this book is just such a collection.  Some of the
stories I do not want to remain buried for ever in the museum
files of dead magazine-numbers&mdash;an author's not
unpardonable vanity; others I have resuscitated from the same
vaults in the hope that they still may please you.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The title of a volume of short stories is always a difficult
matter.  It ought to indicate frankly the nature of the book
so that the unwary purchaser shall have no grievance (except
on the score of merit, which is a different affair altogether)
against either author or publisher.  In my title I have tried
to solve the problem.  But why "Far-away?"  Well, the
stories cover a long stretch of years, and all, save one, were
written in calm days far-away from the present convulsion
of the world.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Anyhow, no one will buy the book under the impression
that it is a novel, and, finding that it isn't, revile me as a
cheat.  And so I have the pleasure of offering it for your
perusal with a clear conscience.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>You, Dear Sir or Madam, have given me, this many a
year, an indulgence beyond my deserts.  Till now, I have
had no opportunity of thanking you.  I do now with a grateful
heart, and to you I dedicate the two stories that I love
the best, hoping that they may excuse those for which you
may not so much care, and that they may win continuance
of that which is to me, both as a writer and as a human
being, my most cherished possession, namely, your
favourable regard for</i>

<h3>
THE SONG OF LIFE
</h3>

<p>
<i>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum</i>.
It is not everybody's good fortune to go to
Corinth.  It is also not everybody's good
fortune to go to Peckham&mdash;still less to live there.
But if you were one of the favoured few, and were
wont to haunt the Peckham Road and High Street,
the bent figure of Angelo Fardetti would have been
as familiar to you as the vast frontage of the great
Emporium which, in the drapery world, makes
Peckham illustrious among London suburbs.  You would
have seen him humbly threading his way through
the female swarms that clustered at the plate-glass
windows&mdash;the mere drones of the hive were fooling
their frivolous lives away over ledgers in the
City&mdash;the inquiry of a lost dog in his patient eyes, and an
unconscious challenge to Philistia in the wiry bush
of white hair that protruded beneath his perky soft
felt hat.  If he had been short, he might have passed
unregarded; but he was very tall&mdash;in his heyday he
had been six foot two&mdash;and very thin.  You smile
as you recall to mind the black frock-coat,
somewhat white at the seams, which, tightly buttoned,
had the fit of a garment of corrugated iron.
Although he was so tall one never noticed the
inconsiderable stretch of trouser below the long skirt.  He
always appeared to be wearing a truncated cassock.
You were inclined to laugh at this queer exotic of
the Peckham Road until you looked more keenly
at the man himself.  Then you saw an old, old
face, very swarthy, very lined, very beautiful still
in its regularity of feature, maintaining in a little
white moustache with waxed ends a pathetic
braggadocio of youth; a face in which the sorrows of
the world seemed to have their dwelling, but
sorrows that on their way thither had passed through
the crucible of a simple soul.
</p>

<p>
Twice a day it was his habit to walk there; shops
and faces a meaningless confusion to his eyes, but
his ears alert to the many harmonies of the orchestra
of the great thoroughfare.  For Angelo Fardetti
was a musician.  Such had he been born; such had
he lived.  Those aspects of life which could not be
interpreted in terms of music were to him
unintelligible.  During his seventy years empires had
crumbled, mighty kingdoms had arisen, bloody wars
had been fought, magic conquests been made by
man over nature.  But none of these convulsive
facts had ever stirred Angelo Fardetti's imagination.
Even his country he had well-nigh forgotten;
it was so many years since he had left it, so much
music had passed since then through his being.
Yet he had never learned to speak English correctly;
and, not having an adequate language (save
music) in which to clothe his thoughts, he spoke
very little.  When addressed he smiled at you
sweetly like a pleasant, inarticulate old child.
</p>

<p>
Though his figure was so familiar to the
inhabitants of Peckham, few knew how and where he
lived.  As a matter of fact, he lived a few hundred
yards away from the busy High Street, in Formosa
Terrace, at the house of one Anton Kirilov, a
musician.  He had lodged with the Kirilovs for over
twenty years&mdash;but not always in the roomy
splendour of Formosa Terrace.  Once Angelo was
first violin in an important orchestra, a man of
mark, while Anton fiddled away in the obscurity
of a fifth-rate music-hall.  Then the famous violinist
rented the drawing-room floor of the Kirilovs' little
house in Clapham, while the Kirilovs, humble folk,
got on as best they could.  Now things had changed.
Anton Kirilov was musical director of a London
theatre, but Angelo, through age and rheumatism
and other infirmities, could fiddle in public no more;
and so it came to pass that Anton Kirilov and Olga,
his wife, and Sonia, their daughter (to whom Angelo
had stood godfather twenty years ago), rioted in
spaciousness, while the old man lodged in tiny
rooms at the top of the house, paying an infinitesimal
rent and otherwise living on his scanty savings
and such few shillings as he could earn by copying
out parts and giving lessons to here and there a
snub-nosed little girl in a tradesman's back parlour.
Often he might have gone without sufficient
nourishment had not Mrs. Kirilov seen to it; and
whenever an extra good dish, succulent and strong,
appeared at her table, either Sonia or the servant
carried a plateful upstairs with homely compliments.
</p>

<p>
"You are making of me a spoiled child, Olga,"
he would say sometimes, "and I ought not to eat of
the food for which Anton works so hard."
</p>

<p>
And she would reply with a laugh:
</p>

<p>
"If we did not keep you alive, Signor Fardetti,
how should we have our quatuors on Sunday afternoons?"
</p>

<p>
You see, Mrs. Kirilov, like the good Anton, had
lived all her life in music too&mdash;she was a pianist;
and Sonia also was a musician&mdash;she played the
'cello in a ladies' orchestra.  So they had famous
Sunday quatuors at Formosa Terrace, in which
Fardetti was well content to play second fiddle to
Anton's first.
</p>

<p>
You see, also, that but for these honest souls to
whom a musician like Fardetti was a sort of
blood-brother, the evening of the old man's days might
have been one of tragic sadness.  But even their
affection and his glad pride in the brilliant success
of his old pupil, Geoffrey Chase, could not mitigate
the one great sorrow of his life.  The violin, yes;
he had played it well; he had not aimed at a great
soloist's fame, for want of early training, and he had
never dreamed such unrealisable dreams; but other
dreams had he dreamed with passionate intensity.
He had dreamed of being a great composer, and he
had beaten his heart out against the bars that shut
him from the great mystery.  A waltz or two, a few
songs, a catchy march, had been published and
performed, and had brought him unprized money and
a little hateful repute; but the compositions into
which he had poured his soul remained in dusty
manuscript, despised and rejected of musical men.
</p>

<p>
For many years the artist's imperious craving to
create and hope and will kept him serene.  Then,
in the prime of his days, a tremendous inspiration
shook him.  He had a divine message to proclaim
to the world, a song of life itself, a revelation.  It
was life, indestructible, eternal.  It was the seed
that grew into the tree; the tree that flourished
lustily, and then grew bare and stark and perished;
the seed, again, of the tree that rose unconquerable
into the laughing leaf of spring.  It was the kiss of
lovers that, when they were dead and gone, lived
immortal on the lips of grandchildren.  It was the
endless roll of the seasons, the majestic, triumphant
rhythm of existence.  It was a cosmic chant, telling
of things as only music could tell of them, and as no
musician had ever told of them before.
</p>

<p>
He attempted the impossible, you will say.  He
did.  That was the pity of it.  He spent the last drop
of his heart's blood over his sonata.  He wrote it
and rewrote it, wasting years, but never could he
imprison within those remorseless ruled lines the
elusive sounds that shook his being.  An approximation
to his dream reached the stage of a completed
score.  But he knew that it was thin and
lifeless.  The themes that were to be developed into
magic harmonies tinkled into commonplace.  The
shell of this vast conception was there, but the shell
alone.  The thing could not live without the
unseizable, and that he had not seized.  Angelo
Fardetti, broken down by toil and misery, fell very
sick.  Doctors recommended Brighton.  Docile as
a child, he went to Brighton, and there a pretty
lady who admired his playing at the Monday Popular
Concerts at St. James's Hall, got hold of him
and married him.  When she ran away, a year later,
with a dashing young stockbroker, he took the score
of the sonata that was to be the whole interpretation
of life from its half-forgotten hiding-place,
played it through on the piano, burst into a passion
of tears, in the uncontrollable Italian way, sold up
his house, and went to lodge with Anton Kirilov.
To no son or daughter of man did he ever show a
note or play a bar of the sonata.  And never again
did he write a line of music.  Bravely and humbly
he faced life, though the tragedy of failure made
him prematurely old.  And all through the years
the sublime message reverberated in his soul and
haunted his dreams; and his was the bitter sorrow
of knowing that never should that message be
delivered for the comforting of the world.
</p>

<p>
The loss of his position as first violin forced him,
at sixty, to take more obscure engagements.  That
was when he followed the Kirilovs to Peckham.
And then he met the joy of his old age&mdash;his one
pupil of genius, Geoffrey Chase, an untrained lad of
fourteen, the son of a well-to-do seed merchant in
the High Street.
</p>

<p>
"His father thinks it waste of time," said
Mrs. Chase, a gentle, mild-eyed woman, when she brought
the boy to him, "but Geoffrey is so set on it&mdash;and
so I've persuaded his father to let him have lessons."
</p>

<p>
"Do you, too, love music?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes grew moist, and she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Poor lady!  He should not let you starve.  Never
mind," he said, patting her shoulder.  "Take
comfort.  I will teach your boy to play for you."
</p>

<p>
And he did.  He taught him for three years.  He
taught him passionately all he knew, for Geoffrey,
with music in his blood, had the great gift of the
composer.  He poured upon the boy all the love of
his lonely old heart, and dreamed glorious dreams
of his future.  The Kirilovs, too, regarded Geoffrey
as a prodigy, and welcomed him into their circle,
and made much of him.  And little Sonia fell in
love with him, and he, in his boyish way, fell in love
with the dark-haired maiden who played on a 'cello
so much bigger than herself.  At last the time came
when Angelo said:
</p>

<p>
"My son, I can teach you no more.  You must go
to Milan."
</p>

<p>
"My father will never consent," said Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
"We will try to arrange that," said Angelo.
</p>

<p>
So, in their simple ways, Angelo and Mrs. Chase
intrigued together until they prevailed upon
Mr. Chase to attend one of the Kirilovs' Sunday
concerts.  He came in church-going clothes, and sat
with irreconcilable stiffness on a straight-backed
chair.  His wife sat close by, much agitated.  The
others played a concerto arranged as a quintette;
Geoffrey first violin, Angelo second, Sonia 'cello,
Anton bass, and Mrs. Kirilov at the piano.  It was
a piece of exquisite tenderness and beauty.
</p>

<p>
"Very pretty," said Mr. Chase.
</p>

<p>
"It's beautiful," cried his wife, with tears in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I said so," remarked Mr. Chase.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think of my pupil?" Angelo
asked excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"I think he plays very nicely," Mr. Chase admitted.
</p>

<p>
"But, dear heavens!" cried Angelo.  "It is not
his playing!  One could pick up fifty better violinists
in the street.  It is the concerto&mdash;the composition."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chase rose slowly to his feet.  "Do you
mean to tell me that Geoffrey made up all that
himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  Didn't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you play it again?"
</p>

<p>
Gladly they assented.  When it was over he took
Angelo out into the passage.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not one of those narrow-minded people who
don't believe in art, Mr. Fardetti," said he.  "And
Geoff has already shown me that he can't sell seeds
for toffee.  But if he takes up music, will he be able
to earn his living at it?"
</p>

<p>
"Beyond doubt," replied Angelo, with a wide
gesture.
</p>

<p>
"But a good living?  You'll forgive me being
personal, Mr. Fardetti, but you yourself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I," said the old man humbly, "am only a poor
fiddler&mdash;but your son is a great musical genius."
</p>

<p>
"I'll think over it," said Mr. Chase.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chase thought over it, and Geoffrey went to
Milan, and Angelo Fardetti was once more left
desolate.  On the day of the lad's departure he and
Sonia wept a little in each other's arms, and late
that night he once more unearthed the completed
score of his sonata, and scanned it through in vain
hope of comfort.  But as the months passed
comfort came.  His beloved swan was not a goose, but
a wonder among swans.  He was a wonder at the
Milan Conservatoire, and won prize after prize and
medal after medal, and every time he came home
he bore his blushing honours thicker upon him.
And he remained the same frank, simple youth,
always filled with gratitude and reverence for his
old master, and though on familiar student terms
with all conditions of cosmopolitan damsels, never
faithless to the little Anglo-Russian maiden whom
he had left at home.
</p>

<p>
In the course of time his studies were over, and
he returned to England.  A professorship at the
Royal School of Music very soon rendered him
financially independent.  He began to create.  Here
and there a piece of his was played at concerts.  He
wrote incidental music for solemn productions at
great London theatres.  Critics discovered him, and
wrote much about him in the newspapers.  Mr. Chase,
the seed merchant, though professing to his
wife a man-of-the-world's indifference to notoriety,
used surreptitiously to cut out the notices and carry
them about in his fat pocket-book, and whenever
he had a new one he would lie in wait for the lean
figure of Angelo Fardetti, and hale him into the
shop and make him drink Geoffrey's health in sloe
gin, which Angelo abhorred, but gulped down in
honour of the prodigy.
</p>

<p>
One fine October morning Angelo Fardetti missed
his walk.  He sat instead by his window, and looked
unseeingly at the prim row of houses on the opposite
side of Formosa Terrace.  He had not the heart to
go out&mdash;and, indeed, he had not the money; for
these walks, twice daily, along the High Street and
the Peckham Road, took him to and from a queer
little Italian restaurant which, with him apparently
as its only client, had eked out for years a mysterious
and precarious existence.  He felt very old&mdash;he
was seventy-two, very useless, very poor.  He
had lost his last pupil, a fat, unintelligent girl of
thirteen, the daughter of a local chemist, and no one
had sent him any copying work for a week.  He had
nothing to do.  He could not even walk to his usual
sparrow's meal.  It is sad when you are so old that
you cannot earn the right to live in a world which
wants you no longer.
</p>

<p>
Looking at unseen bricks through a small
window-pane was little consolation.  Mechanically he
rose and went to a grand piano, his one possession
of price, which, with an old horsehair sofa, an oval
table covered with a maroon cloth, and a chair or
two, congested the tiny room, and, sitting down,
began to play one of Stephen Heller's <i>Nuits Blanches</i>.
You see, Angelo Fardetti was an old-fashioned
musician.  Suddenly a phrase arrested him.  He stopped
dead, and remained staring out over the polished
plane of the piano.  For a few moments he was lost
in the chain of associated musical ideas.  Then
suddenly his swarthy, lined face lit up, and he twirled
his little white moustache and began to improvise,
striking great majestic chords.  Presently he rose,
and from a pile of loose music in a corner drew a
sheet of ruled paper.  He returned to the piano,
and began feverishly to pencil down his inspiration.
His pulses throbbed.  At last he had got the great
andante movement of his sonata.  For an hour he
worked intensely; then came the inevitable check.
Nothing more would come.  He rose and walked
about the room, his head swimming.  After a quarter
of an hour he played over what he had written, and
then, with a groan of despair, fell forward, his arms
on the keys, his bushy white head on his arms.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and Sonia, comely and shapely,
entered the room, carrying a tray with food and
drink set out on a white cloth.  Seeing him bowed
over the piano, she put the tray on the table and
advanced.
</p>

<p>
"Dear godfather," she said gently, her hand on
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He raised his head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I did not hear you, my little Sonia."
</p>

<p>
"You have been composing?"
</p>

<p>
He sat upright, and tore the pencilled sheets into
fragments, which he dropped in a handful on the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"Once, long ago, I had a dream.  I lost it.  To-day
I thought that I had found it.  But do you know
what I did really find?"
</p>

<p>
"No, godfather," replied Sonia, stooping, with
housewifely tidiness, to pick up the litter.
</p>

<p>
"That I am a poor old fool," said he.
</p>

<p>
Sonia threw the paper into the grate and again
came up behind him.
</p>

<p>
"It is better to have lost a dream than never to
have had one at all.  What was your dream?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I could write the Song of Life as I
heard it&mdash;as I hear it still."  He smote his
forehead lightly.  "But no!  God has not considered
me worthy to sing it.  I bow my head to His&mdash;to
His"&mdash;he sought for the word with thin fingers&mdash;"to
His decree."
</p>

<p>
She said, with the indulgent wisdom of youth
speaking to age:
</p>

<p>
"He has given you the power to love and to win
love."
</p>

<p>
The old man swung round on the music-stool and
put his arm round her waist and smiled into her
young face.
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey is a very fortunate fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Because he's a successful composer?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and shook his head, and Sonia,
knowing what he meant, blushed very prettily.
Then she laughed and broke away.
</p>

<p>
"Mother has had seventeen partridges sent her
as presents this week, and she wants you to help
her eat them, and father's offered a bargain in some
good Beaujolais, and won't decide until you tell
him what you think of it."
</p>

<p>
Deftly she set out the meal, and drew a chair to
the table.  Angelo Fardetti rose.
</p>

<p>
"That I should love you all," said he simply,
"is only human, but that you should so much love
me is more than I can understand."
</p>

<p>
You see, he knew that watchful ears had missed
his usual outgoing footsteps, and that watchful
hearts had divined the reason.  To refuse, to
hesitate, would be to reject love.  So there was no
more to be said.  He sat down meekly, and Sonia
ministered to his wants.  As soon as she saw that
he was making headway with the partridge and the
burgundy, she too sat by the table.
</p>

<p>
"Godfather," she said, "I've had splendid news
this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  What other news could be splendid?
His Symphony in E flat is going to be given at the
Queen's Hall."
</p>

<p>
"That is indeed beautiful news," said the old
man, laying down knife and fork, "but I did not
know that he had written a Symphony in E flat."
</p>

<p>
"That was why he went and buried himself for
months in Cornwall&mdash;to finish it," she explained.
</p>

<p>
"I knew nothing about it.  Aie!  aie!" he sighed.
"It is to you, and no longer to me, that he tells
things."
</p>

<p>
"You silly, jealous old dear!" she laughed.  "He
<i>had</i> to account for deserting me all the summer.  But
as to what it's all about, I'm as ignorant as you are.
I've not heard a note of it.  Sometimes Geoff is like
that, you know.  If he's dead certain sure of
himself, he won't have any criticism or opinions while
the work's in progress.  It's only when he's
doubtful that he brings one in.  And the doubtful things
are never anything like the certain ones.  You must
have noticed it."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," said Angelo Fardetti, taking up
knife and fork again.  "He was like that since he
was a boy."
</p>

<p>
"It is going to be given on Saturday fortnight.
He'll conduct himself.  They've got a splendid
programme to send him off.  Lembrich's going to play,
and Carli's going to sing&mdash;just for his sake.  Isn't
it gorgeous?"
</p>

<p>
"It is grand.  But what does Geoffrey say about
it?  Come, come, after all he is not the sphinx."  He
drummed his fingers impatiently on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Would you really like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting."
</p>

<p>
"He says it's going to knock 'em!" she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Knock 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Those were his words."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She interpreted into purer English.  Geoffrey
was confident that his symphony would achieve a
sensational success.
</p>

<p>
"In the meanwhile," said she, "if you don't
finish your partridge you'll break mother's heart."
</p>

<p>
She poured out a glass of burgundy, which the
old man drank; but he refused the food.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he said, "I cannot eat more.  I have
a lump there&mdash;in my throat.  I am too excited.
I feel that he is marching to his great triumph.  My
little Geoffrey."  He rose, knocking his chair over,
and strode about the confined space.  "<i>Sacramento</i>!
But I am a wicked old man.  I was sorrowful because
I was so dull, so stupid that I could not write a
sonata.  I blamed the good God.  <i>Mea maxima
culpa</i>.  And at once he sends me a partridge in a
halo of love, and the news of my dear son's glory&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sonia stopped him, her plump hands on the front
of his old corrugated frock-coat.
</p>

<p>
"And your glory, too, dear godfather.  If it
hadn't been for you, where would Geoffrey be?
And who realises it more than Geoffrey?  Would
you like to see a bit of his letter?  Only a little
bit&mdash;for there's a lot of rubbish in it that I would be
ashamed of anybody who thinks well of him to
read&mdash;but just a little bit."
</p>

<p>
Her hand was at the broad belt joining blouse
and skirt.  Angelo, towering above her, smiled with
an old man's tenderness at the laughing love in
her dark eyes, and at the happiness in her young,
comely face.  Her features were generous, and her
mouth frankly large, but her lips were fresh and her
teeth white and even, and to the old fellow she
looked all that man could dream of the virginal
mother-to-be of great sons.  She fished the letter
from her belt, scanned and folded it carefully.
</p>

<p>
"There!  Read."
</p>

<p>
And Angelo Fardetti read:
</p>

<p>
"I've learned my theory and technique, and God
knows what&mdash;things that only they could teach
me&mdash;from professors with world-famous names.
But for real inspiration, for the fount of music itself,
I come back all the time to our dear old <i>maestro</i>,
Angelo Fardetti.  I can't for the life of me define
what it is, but he opened for me a secret chamber
behind whose concealed door all these illustrious
chaps have walked unsuspectingly.  It seems silly
to say it because, beyond a few odds and ends, the
dear old man has composed nothing, but I am
convinced that I owe the essentials of everything I do
in music to his teaching and influence."
</p>

<p>
Angelo gave her back the folded letter without a
word, and turned and stood again by the window,
staring unseeingly at the prim, semi-detached villas
opposite.  Sonia, having re-hidden her treasure,
stole up to him.  Feeling her near, he stretched out
a hand and laid it on her head.
</p>

<p>
"God is very wonderful," said he&mdash;"very
mysterious.  Oh, and so good!"
</p>

<p>
He fumbled, absently and foolishly, with her
well-ordered hair, saying nothing more.  After a
while she freed herself gently and led him back to
his partridge.
</p>

<p>
A day or two afterwards Geoffrey came to
Peckham, and mounted with Sonia to Fardetti's rooms,
where the old man embraced him tenderly, and
expressed his joy in the exuberant foreign way.
Geoffrey received the welcome with an Englishman's
laughing embarrassment.  Perhaps the only fault
that Angelo Fardetti could find in the beloved
pupil was his uncompromising English manner and
appearance.  His well-set figure and crisp, short
fair hair and fair moustache did not sufficiently
express him as a great musician.  Angelo had to
content himself with the lad's eyes&mdash;musician's
eyes, as he said, very bright, arresting, dark blue,
with depths like sapphires, in which lay strange
thoughts and human laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I've only run in, dear old <i>maestro</i>, to pass the
time of day with you, and to give you a ticket for
my Queen's Hall show.  You'll come, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"He asks if I will come!  I would get out of my
coffin and walk through the streets!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you'll be pleased," said Geoffrey.  "I've
been goodness knows how long over it, and I've
put into it all I know.  If it doesn't come off, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused.
</p>

<p>
"You will commit no rashness," cried the old
man in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"I will.  I'll marry Sonia the very next day!"
</p>

<p>
There was laughing talk, and the three spent a
happy little quarter of an hour.  But Geoffrey went
away without giving either of the others an inkling
of the nature of his famous symphony.  It was
Geoffrey's way.
</p>

<p>
The fateful afternoon arrived.  Angelo Fardetti,
sitting in the stalls of the Queen's Hall with Sonia
and her parents, looked round the great auditorium,
and thrilled with pleasure at seeing it full.  London
had thronged to hear the first performance of his
beloved's symphony.  As a matter of fact, London
had also come to hear the wonderful orchestra give
Tchaikowsky's Fourth Symphony, and to hear
Lembrich play the violin and Carli sing, which they
did once in a blue moon at a symphony concert.
But in the old man's eyes these ineffectual fires
paled before Geoffrey's genius.  So great was his
suspense and agitation that he could pay but scant
attention to the first two items on the programme.
It seemed almost like unmeaning music, far away.
</p>

<p>
During the interval before the Symphony in E
flat his thin hand found Sonia's, and held it tight,
and she returned the pressure.  She, too, was sick
with anxiety.  The great orchestra, tier upon tier,
was a-flutter with the performers scrambling into
their places, and with leaves of scores being turned
over, and with a myriad moving bows.  Then all
having settled into the order of a vast machine,
Geoffrey appeared at the conductor's stand.
Comforting applause greeted him.  Was he not the
rising hope of English music?  Many others beside
those four to whom he was dear, and the mother
and father who sat a little way in front of them,
felt the same nervous apprehension.  The future of
English music was at stake.  Would it be yet one
more disappointment and disillusion, or would it
rank the young English composer with the immortals?
Geoffrey bowed smilingly at the audience,
turned and with his baton gave the signal to begin.
</p>

<p>
Although only a few years have passed since that
memorable first performance, the modestly named
Symphony in E flat is now famous and Geoffrey
Chase is a great man the wide world over.  To every
lover of music the symphony is familiar.  But only
those who were present at the Queen's Hall on that
late October afternoon can realise the wild rapture
of enthusiasm with which the symphony was greeted.
It answered all longings, solved all mysteries.  It
interpreted, for all who had ears to hear, the fairy
dew of love, the burning depths of passion, sorrow and
death, and the eternal Triumph of Life.  Intensely
modern and faultless in technique, it was new,
unexpected, individual, unrelated to any school.
</p>

<p>
The scene was one of raging tumult; but there
was one human being who did not applaud, and
that was the old musician, forgotten of the world,
Angelo Fardetti.  He had fainted.
</p>

<p>
All through the piece he had sat, bolt upright,
his nerves strung to breaking-point, his dark cheeks
growing greyer and greyer, and the stare in his
eyes growing more and more strange, and the grip
on the girl's hand growing more and more vice-like,
until she, for sheer agony, had to free herself.  And
none concerned themselves about him; not even
Sonia, for she was enwrapped in the soul of her
lover's music.  And even between the movements
her heart was too full for speech or thought, and
when she looked at the old man, she saw him smile
wanly and nod his head as one who, like herself,
was speechless with emotion.  At the end the storm
burst.  She rose with the shouting, clapping,
hand- and handkerchief-waving house, and suddenly,
missing him from her side, glanced round and saw him
huddled up unconscious in his stall.
</p>

<p>
The noise and movement were so great that few
noticed the long lean old figure being carried out
of the hall by one of the side doors fortunately near.
In the vestibule, attended by the good Anton and
his wife and Sonia, and a commissionaire, he
recovered.  When he could speak, he looked round
and said:
</p>

<p>
"I am a silly old fellow.  I am sorry I have spoiled
your happiness.  I think I must be too old for
happiness, for this is how it has treated me."
</p>

<p>
There was much discussion between his friends
as to what should be done, but good Mrs. Kirilov,
once girlishly plump, when Angelo had first known
her, now florid and fat and motherly, had her way,
and, leaving Anton and Sonia to see the hero of the
afternoon, if they could, drove off in a cab to
Peckham with the over-wrought old man and put him
to bed and gave him homely remedies, invalid food
and drink, and commanded him to sleep till morning.
</p>

<p>
But Angelo Fardetti disobeyed her.  For Sonia,
although she had found him meekly between the
sheets when she went up to see him that evening,
heard him later, as she was going to bed&mdash;his
sitting-room was immediately above her&mdash;playing
over, on muted strings, various themes of Geoffrey's
symphony.  At last she went up to his room and put
her head in at the door, and saw him, a lank,
dilapidated figure in an old, old dressing-gown, fiddle
and bow in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! oh!" she rated.  "You are a naughty,
naughty old dear.  Go to bed at once."
</p>

<p>
He smiled like a guilty but spoiled child.  "I will
go," said he.
</p>

<p>
In the morning she herself took up his simple
breakfast and all the newspapers folded at the page
on which the notices of the concert were printed.
The Press was unanimous in acclamation of the
great genius that had raised English music to the
spheres.  She sat at the foot of the bed and read to
him while he sipped his coffee and munched his roll,
and, absorbed in her own tremendous happiness,
was content to feel the glow of the old man's
sympathy.  There was little to be said save exclamatory
pæans, so overwhelming was the triumph.  Tears
streamed down his lined cheeks, and between the
tears there shone the light of a strange gladness in
his eyes.  Presently Sonia left him and went about
her household duties.  An hour or so afterwards
she caught the sound of his piano; again he was
recalling bits of the great symphony, and she
marvelled at his musical memory.  Then about half-past
eleven she saw him leave the house and stride
away, his head in the air, his bent shoulders curiously
erect.
</p>

<p>
Soon came the clatter of a cab stopping at the
front door, and Geoffrey Chase, for whom she had
been watching from her window, leaped out upon
the pavement.  She ran down and admitted him.
He caught her in his arms and they stood clinging
in a long embrace.
</p>

<p>
"It's too wonderful to talk about," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't let us talk about it," he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"As if we could help it!  I can think of nothing
else."
</p>

<p>
"I can&mdash;you," said he, and kissed her again.
</p>

<p>
Now, in spite of the spaciousness of the house in
Formosa Terrace, it had only two reception-rooms,
as the house-agents grandiloquently term them, and
these, dining-room and drawing-room, were respectively
occupied by Anton and Mrs. Kirilov engaged
in their morning lessons.  The passage where the
young people stood was no fit place for lovers'
meetings.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go up to the <i>maestro's</i>.  He's out," said
Sonia.
</p>

<p>
They did as they had often done in like
circumstances.  Indeed, the old man, before now, had
given up his sitting-room to them, feigning an
unconquerable desire to walk abroad.  Were they not
his children, dearer to him than anyone else in the
world?  So it was natural that they should make
themselves at home in his tiny den.  They sat and
talked of the great victory, of the playing of the
orchestra, of passages that he might take slower or
quicker next time, of the ovation, of the mountain
of congratulatory telegrams and letters that blocked
up his rooms.  They talked of Angelo Fardetti and
his deep emotion and his pride.  And they talked
of the future, of their marriage which was to take
place very soon.  She suggested postponement.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to be quite sure.  This must make
a difference."
</p>

<p>
"Difference!" he cried indignantly.
</p>

<p>
She waved him off and sat on the music-stool by
the piano.
</p>

<p>
"I must speak sensibly.  You are one of the
great ones of the musical world, one of the great
ones of the world itself.  You will go on and on.
You will have all sorts of honours heaped on you.
You will go about among lords and ladies, what is
called Society&mdash;oh, I know, you'll not be able to
help it.  And all the time I remain what I am, just
a poor little common girl, a member of a
twopenny-halfpenny ladies' band.  I'd rather you regretted
having taken up with me before than after.  So we
ought to put it off."
</p>

<p>
He answered her as a good man who loves deeply
can only answer.  Her heart was convinced; but
she turned her head aside and thought of further
argument.  Her eye fell on some music open on the
rest, and mechanically, with a musician's instinct,
she fingered a few bars.  The strange familiarity of
the theme startled her out of preoccupation.  She
continued the treble, and suddenly with a cold
shiver of wonder, crashed down both hands and
played on.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey strode up to her.
</p>

<p>
"What's that you're playing?"
</p>

<p>
She pointed hastily to the score.  He bent over
and stared at the faded manuscript.
</p>

<p>
"Why, good God!" he cried, "it's my symphony."
</p>

<p>
She stopped, swung round and faced him with
fear in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's your symphony."
</p>

<p>
He took the thick manuscript from the rest and
looked at the brown-paper cover.  On it was written:
</p>

<p>
"The Song of Life.  A Sonata by Angelo Fardetti.
September, 1878."
</p>

<p>
There was an amazed silence.  Then, in a queer
accusing voice, Sonia cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey, what have you done?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows; but I've never known of this
before.  My God!  Open the thing somewhere else
and see."
</p>

<p>
So Sonia opened the manuscript at random and
played, and again it was an echo of Geoffrey's
symphony.  He sank on a chair like a man crushed by
an overwhelming fatality, and held his head in his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"I oughtn't to have done it," he groaned.  "But
it was more than me.  The thing overmastered me,
it haunted me so that I couldn't sleep, and the more
it haunted me the more it became my own, my very
own.  It was too big to lose."
</p>

<p>
Sonia held him with scared eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking of?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The way I came to write the Symphony.  It's
like a nightmare."  He rose.  "A couple of years
ago," said he, "I bought a bundle of old music at
a second-hand shop.  It contained a collection of
eighteenth-century stuff which I wanted.  I took
the whole lot, and on going through it, found a clump
of old, discoloured manuscript partly in faded brown
ink, partly in pencil.  It was mostly rough notes.
I tried it out of curiosity.  The composition was
feeble and the orchestration childish&mdash;I thought
it the work of some dead and forgotten amateur&mdash;but
it was crammed full of ideas, crammed full of
beauty.  I began tinkering it about, to amuse
myself.  The more I worked on it the more it fascinated
me.  It became an obsession.  Then I pitched the
old score away and started it on my own."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>maestro</i> sold a lot of old music about that
time," said Sonia.
</p>

<p>
The young man threw up his hands.  "It's a
fatality, an awful fatality.  My God," he cried,
"to think that I of all men should have stolen
Angelo Fardetti's music!"
</p>

<p>
"No wonder he fainted yesterday," said Sonia.
</p>

<p>
It was catastrophe.  Both regarded it in remorseful
silence.  Sonia said at last:
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to explain."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course.  But what must the dear
old fellow be thinking of me?  What else but that
I've got hold of this surreptitiously, while he was
out of the room?  What else but that I'm a mean
thief?"
</p>

<p>
"He loves you, dear, enough to forgive you anything."
</p>

<p>
"It's the Unforgivable Sin.  I'm wiped out.  I
cease to exist as an honest man.  But I had no
idea," he cried, with the instinct of self-defence,
"that I had come so near him.  I thought I had just
got a theme here and there.  I thought I had recast
all the odds and ends according to my own scheme."  He
ran his eye over a page or two of the score.
"Yes, this is practically the same as the old rough
notes.  But there was a lot, of course, I couldn't use.
Look at that, for instance."  He indicated a passage.
</p>

<p>
"I can't read it like you," said Sonia.  "I must
play it."
</p>

<p>
She turned again to the piano, and played the
thin, uninspired music that had no relation to the
Symphony in E flat, and her eyes filled with tears
as she remembered poignantly what the old man
had told her of his Song of Life.  She went on and
on until the music quickened into one of the familiar
themes; and the tears fell, for she knew how poorly
it was treated.
</p>

<p>
And then the door burst open.  Sonia stopped dead
in the middle of a bar, and they both turned round
to find Angelo Fardetti standing on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no!" he cried, waving his thin hands.  "Put
that away.  I did not know I had left it out.  You
must not play that.  Ah, my son! my son!"
</p>

<p>
He rushed forward and clasped Geoffrey in his
arms, and kissed him on the cheeks, and murmured
foolish, broken words.
</p>

<p>
"You have seen it.  You have seen the miracle.
The miracle of the good God.  Oh, I am happy!
My son, my son!  I am the happiest of old men.
Ah!"  He shook him tremulously by both shoulders,
and looked at him with a magical light in his old
eyes.  "You are really what our dear Anton calls
a prodigy.  I have thought and you have executed.
Santa Maria!" he cried, raising hands and eyes to
heaven.  "I thank you for this miracle that has
been done!"
</p>

<p>
He turned away.  Geoffrey, in blank bewilderment,
made a step forward.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Maestro</i>, I never knew&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Sonia, knowledge dawning in her face,
clapped her hand over his mouth&mdash;and he read
her conjecture in her eyes, and drew a great breath.
The old man came again and laughed and cried and
wrung his hand, and poured out his joy and wonder
into the amazed ears of the conscience-stricken
young musician.  The floodgates of speech were
loosened.
</p>

<p>
"You see what you have done, <i>figlio mio</i>.  You
see the miracle.  This&mdash;this poor rubbish is of
me, Angelo Fardetti.  On it I spent my life, my
blood, my tears, and it is a thing of nothing, nothing.
It is wind and noise; but by the miracle of God I
breathed it into your spirit and it grew&mdash;and it
grew into all that I dreamed&mdash;all that I dreamed
and could not express.  It is my Song of Life sung
as I could have sung it if I had been a great genius
like you.  And you have taken my song from my
soul, from my heart, and all the sublime harmonies
that could get no farther than this dull head you
have put down in immortal music."
</p>

<p>
He went on exalted, and Sonia and Geoffrey stood
pale and silent.  To undeceive him was impossible.
</p>

<p>
"You see it is a miracle?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Geoffrey in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"You never saw this before.  Ha! ha!" he laughed
delightedly.  "Not a human soul has seen it or
heard it.  I kept it locked up there, in my little
strong-box.  And it was there all the time I was
teaching you.  And you never suspected."
</p>

<p>
"No, <i>maestro</i>, I did not," said the young man
truthfully.
</p>

<p>
"Now, when did you begin to think of it?  How
did it come to you&mdash;my Song of Life?  Did it sing
in your brain while you were here and my brain was
guiding yours, and then gather form and shape all
through the long years?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Geoffrey.  "That was how it came about."

<p>
Angelo took Sonia's plump cheeks between his
hands and smiled.  "Now you understand, my little
Sonia, why I was so foolish yesterday.  It was
emotion, such emotion as a man has never felt before in
the world.  And now you know why I could not speak
this morning.  I thought of the letter you showed me.
He confessed that old Angelo Fardetti had inspired
him, but he did not know how.  I know.  The little
spark flew from the soul of Angelo Fardetti into his
soul, and it became a Divine Fire.  And my Song of
Life is true.  The symphony was born in me&mdash;it
died in me&mdash;it is re-born so gloriously in him.  The
seed is imperishable.  It is eternal."
</p>

<p>
He broke away, laughing through a little sob, and
stood by the window, once more gazing unseeingly
at the opposite villas of Formosa Terrace.  Geoffrey
went up to him and fell on his knees&mdash;it was a most
un-English thing to do&mdash;and took the old hand
very reverently.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Padre mio</i>," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is true.  I am your father," said the old
man in Italian, "and we are bound together by
more than human ties."  He laid his hand on the
young man's head.  "May all the blessings of God
be upon you."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey rose, the humblest man in England.
Angelo passed his hand across his forehead, but his
face bore a beautiful smile.
</p>

<p>
"I feel so happy," said he.  "So happy that it is
terrible.  And I feel so strange.  And my heart is
full.  If you will forgive me, I will lie down for a
little."  He sank on the horse-hair sofa and smiled
up in the face of the young man.  "And my head
is full of the <i>andante</i> movement that I could never
write, and you have made it like the harmonies
before the Throne of God.  Sit down at the piano
and play it for me, my son."
</p>

<p>
So Geoffrey took his seat at the piano, and played,
and as he played, he lost himself in his music.  And
Sonia crept near and stood by him in a dream while
the wonderful story of the passing of human things
was told.  When the sound of the last chords had
died away she put her arms round Geoffrey's neck
and laid her cheek against his.  For a while time
stood still.  Then they turned and saw the old man
sleeping peacefully.  She whispered a word, he rose,
and they began to tiptoe out of the room.  But
suddenly instinct caused Sonia to turn her head
again.  She stopped and gripped Geoffrey's hand.
She caught a choking breath.
</p>

<p>
"Is he asleep?"
</p>

<p>
They went back and bent over him.  He was dead.
</p>

<p>
Angelo Fardetti had died of a happiness too great
for mortal man.  For to which one of us in a
hundred million is it given to behold the utter
realisation of his life's dream?

LADIES IN LAVENDER

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p>
As soon as the sun rose out of the sea its light
streamed through a white-curtained
casement window into the whitest and most
spotless room you can imagine.  It shone upon two
little white beds, separated by the width of the floor
covered with straw-coloured matting; on white
garments neatly folded which lay on white chairs
by the side of each bed; on a white enamelled
bedroom suite; on the one picture (over the mantel-piece)
which adorned the white walls, the enlarged
photograph of a white-whiskered, elderly gentleman
in naval uniform; and on the white, placid faces of
the sleepers.
</p>

<p>
It awakened Miss Ursula Widdington, who sat
up in bed, greeted it with a smile, and forthwith
aroused her sister.
</p>

<p>
"Janet, here's the sun."
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington awoke and smiled too.
</p>

<p>
Now to awake at daybreak with a smile and a
childlike delight at the sun when you are over
forty-five is a sign of an unruffled conscience and a sweet
disposition.
</p>

<p>
"The first glimpse of it for a week," said Miss
Widdington.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it strange," said Miss Ursula, "that when
we went to sleep the storm was still raging?"
</p>

<p>
"And now&mdash;the sea hasn't gone down yet.  Listen."
</p>

<p>
"The tide's coming in.  Let us go out and look
at it," cried Miss Ursula, delicately getting out of
bed.
</p>

<p>
"You're so impulsive, Ursula," said Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
She was forty-eight, and three years older than
her sister.  She could, therefore, smile indulgently
at the impetuosity of youth.  But she rose and
dressed, and presently the two ladies stole out of
the silent house.
</p>

<p>
They had lived there for many years, perched away
on top of a projecting cliff on the Cornish coast,
midway between sea and sky, like two fairy princesses
in an enchanted bit of the world's end, who had
grown grey with waiting for the prince who never
came.  Theirs was the only house on the
wind-swept height.  Below in the bay on the right of
their small headland nestled the tiny fishing village
of Trevannic; below, sheer down to the left, lay
a little sandy cove, accessible farther on by a
narrow gorge that split the majestic stretch of bastioned
cliffs.  To that little stone weatherbeaten house
their father, the white-whiskered gentleman of the
portrait, had brought them quite young when he
had retired from the navy with a pension and a
grievance&mdash;an ungrateful country had not made
him an admiral&mdash;and there, after his death, they
had continued to lead their remote and gentle lives,
untouched by the happenings of the great world.
</p>

<p>
The salt-laden wind buffeted them, dashed strands
of hair stingingly across their faces and swirled their
skirts around them as they leaned over the stout
stone parapet their father had built along the edge
of the cliff, and drank in the beauty of the morning.
The eastern sky was clear of clouds and the eastern
sea tossed a fierce silver under the sun and gradually
deepened into frosted green, which changed in the
west into the deep ocean blue; and the Atlantic
heaved and sobbed after its turmoil of the day
before.  Miss Ursula pointed to the gilt-edged clouds
in the west and likened them to angels' thrones,
which was a pretty conceit.  Miss Widdington
derived a suggestion of Pentecostal flames from the
golden flashes of the sea-gulls' wings.  Then she
referred to the appetite they would have for
breakfast.  To this last observation Miss Ursula did not
reply, as she was leaning over the parapet intent
on something in the cove below.  Presently she
clutched her sister's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Janet, look down there&mdash;that black thing&mdash;what is it?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington's gaze followed the pointing
finger.
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the rocks that edged the gorge
sprawled a thing checkered black and white.
</p>

<p>
"I do believe it's a man!"
</p>

<p>
"A drowned man!  Oh, poor fellow!  Oh, Janet,
how dreadful!"
</p>

<p>
She turned brown, compassionate eyes on her
sister, who continued to peer keenly at the helpless
figure below.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he's dead, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
"The sensible thing would be to go down and see,"
replied Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means the first dead man cast up by
the waves that they had stumbled upon during their
long sojourn on this wild coast, where wrecks and
founderings and loss of men's lives at sea were
commonplace happenings.  They were dealing with the
sadly familiar; and though their gentle hearts
throbbed hard as they made for the gorge and sped
quickly down the ragged, rocky path, they set
about their task as a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula reached the sand first, and walked
over to the body which lay on a low shelf of rock.
Then she turned with a glad cry.
</p>

<p>
"Janet.  He's alive.  He's moaning.  Come
quickly."  And, as Janet joined her: "Did you
ever see such a beautiful face in your life?"
</p>

<p>
"We should have brought some brandy," said
Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
But, as she bent over the unconscious form, a
foolish moisture gathered in her eyes which had
nothing to do with forgetfulness of alcohol.  For
indeed there lay sprawling anyhow in catlike grace
beneath them the most romantic figure of a youth
that the sight of maiden ladies ever rested on.  He
had long black hair, a perfectly chiselled face, a
preposterously feminine mouth which, partly open,
showed white young teeth, and the most delicate,
long-fingered hands in the world.  Miss Ursula
murmured that he was like a young Greek god.
Miss Widdington sighed.  The fellow was ridiculous.
He was also dank with sea water, and moaned
as if he were in pain.  But as gazing wrapt in wonder
and admiration at young Greek gods is not much
good to them when they are half-drowned, Miss
Widdington despatched her sister in search of help.
</p>

<p>
"The tide is still low enough for you to get round
the cliff to the village.  Mrs. Pendered will give you
some brandy, and her husband and Luke will bring
a stretcher.  You might also send Joe Gullow on
his bicycle for Dr. Mead."
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington, as behoved one who has the
charge of an orphaned younger sister, did not allow
the sentimental to weaken the practical.  Miss
Ursula, though she would have preferred to stay
by the side of the beautiful youth, was docile, and
went forthwith on her errand.  Miss Widdington,
left alone with him, rolled up her jacket and
pillowed his head on it, brought his limbs into an
attitude suggestive of comfort, and tried by chafing
to restore him to animation.  Being unsuccessful in
this, she at last desisted, and sat on the rocks near
by and wondered who on earth he was and where in
the world he came from.  His garments consisted
in a nondescript pair of trousers and a flannel shirt
with a collar, which was fastened at the neck, not
by button or stud, but by a tasselled cord; and he
was barefoot.  Miss Widdington glanced modestly
at his feet, which were shapely; and the soles were
soft and pink like the palms of his hands.  Now,
had he been the coarsest and most callosity-stricken
shell-back half-alive, Janet Widdington would have
tended him with the same devotion; but the lingering
though unoffending Eve in her rejoiced that hands
and feet betokened gentler avocations than that of
sailor or fisherman.  And why?  Heaven knows,
save that the stranded creature had a pretty face
and that his long black hair was flung over his
forehead in a most interesting manner.  She wished
he would open his eyes.  But as he kept them shut
and gave no sign of returning consciousness, she
sat there waiting patiently; in front of her the rough,
sun-kissed Atlantic, at her feet the semicircular
patch of golden sand, behind her the sheer white
cliffs, and by her side on the slab of rock this
good-looking piece of jetsam.
</p>

<p>
At length Miss Ursula appeared round the corner
of the headland, followed by Jan Pendered and his
son Luke carrying a stretcher.  While Miss
Widdington administered brandy without any obvious
result, the men looked at the castaway, scratched
their heads, and guessed him to be a foreigner;
but how he managed to be there alone with never a
bit of wreckage to supply a clue surpassed their
powers of imagination.  In lifting him the right
foot hung down through the trouser-leg, and his
ankle was seen to be horribly black and swollen.
Old Jan examined it carefully.
</p>

<p>
"Broken," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor boy, that's why he's moaning so,"
cried the compassionate Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
The men grasped the handles of the stretcher.
</p>

<p>
"I'd better take him home to my old woman,"
said Jan Pendered thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"He can have my bed, father," said Luke.
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington looked at Miss Ursula and Miss
Ursula looked at Miss Widdington, and the eyes of
each lady were wistful.  Then Miss Widdington
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You can carry him up to the house, Pendered.
We have a comfortable spare room, and Dorcas
will help us to look after him."
</p>

<p>
The men obeyed, for in Trevannic Miss Widdington's
gentle word was law.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
It was early afternoon.  Miss Widdington had
retired to take her customary after-luncheon siesta,
an indulgence permitted to her seniority, but not
granted, except on rare occasions, to the young.
Miss Ursula, therefore, kept watch in the sick
chamber, just such a little white spotless room as
their own, but containing only one little white bed
in which the youth lay dry and warm and
comfortably asleep.  He was exhausted from cold and
exposure, said the doctor who had driven in from
St. Madoc, eight miles off, and his ankle was broken.
The doctor had done what was necessary, had
swathed him in one of old Dorcas's flannel
nightgowns, and had departed.  Miss Ursula had the
patient all to herself.  A bright fire burned in the
grate, and the strong Atlantic breeze came in through
the open window where she sat, her knitting in her
hand.  Now and then she glanced at the sleeper,
longing, in a most feminine manner, for him to awake
and render an account of himself.  Miss Ursula's
heart fluttered mildly.  For beautiful youths,
baffling curiosity, are not washed up alive by the sea
at an old maid's feet every day in the week.  It
was indeed an adventure, a bit of a fairy tale
suddenly gleaming and dancing in the grey atmosphere
of an eventless life.  She glanced at him again, and
wondered whether he had a mother.  Presently
Dorcas came in, stout and matronly, and cast a
maternal eye on the boy and smoothed his pillow.
She had sons herself, and two of them had been
claimed by the pitiless sea.
</p>

<p>
"It's lucky I had a sensible nightgown to give
him," she remarked.  "If we had had only the
flimsy things that you and Miss Janet wear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sh!" said Miss Ursula, colouring faintly;
"he might hear you."
</p>

<p>
Dorcas laughed and went out.  Miss Ursula's
needles clicked rapidly.  When she glanced at the
bed again she became conscious of two great dark
eyes regarding her in utter wonder.  She rose
quickly and went over to the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid," she said, though what there
was to terrify him in her mild demeanour and the
spotless room she could not have explained; "don't
be afraid, you're among friends."
</p>

<p>
He murmured some words which she did not catch.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?" she asked sweetly.
</p>

<p>
He repeated them in a stronger voice.  Then she
realised that he spoke in a foreign tongue.  A queer
dismay filled her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you speak English?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her for a moment, puzzled.  Then
the echo of the last word seemed to reach his
intelligence.  He shook his head.  A memory rose
from schoolgirl days.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parlez-vous français?</i>" she faltered; and when
he shook his head again she almost felt relieved.
Then he began to talk, regarding her earnestly, as
if seeking by his mere intentness to make her
understand.  But it was a strange language which she
had not heard before.
</p>

<p>
In one mighty effort Miss Ursula gathered together
her whole stock of German.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sprechen Sie deutsch?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ach ja!  Einige Worte,</i>" he replied, and his
face lit up with a smile so radiant that Miss Ursula
wondered how Providence could have neglected to
inspire a being so beautiful with a knowledge of the
English language, "<i>Ich kann mich auf deutsch
verständlich machen, aber ich bin polnisch</i>."
</p>

<p>
But not a word of the halting sentence could Miss
Ursula make out; even the last was swallowed up
in guttural unintelligibility.  She only recognised
the speech as German and different from that which
he used at first, and which seemed to be his native
tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, I must give it up," she sighed.
</p>

<p>
The patient moved slightly and uttered a sudden
cry of pain.  It occurred to Miss Ursula that he
had not had time to realise the fractured ankle.
That he realised it now was obvious, for he lay back
with closed eyes and white lips until the spasm had
passed.  After that Miss Ursula did her best to
explain in pantomime what had happened.  She
made a gesture of swimming, then laid her cheek on
her hand and simulated fainting, acted her
discovery of his body on the beach, broke a wooden
match in two and pointed to his ankle, exhibited
the medicine bottles by the bedside, smoothed his
pillow, and smiled so as to assure him of kind
treatment.  He understood, more or less, murmured
thanks in his own language, took her hand, and to
her English woman's astonishment, pressed it to
his lips.  Miss Widdington, entering softly, found
the pair in this romantic situation.
</p>

<p>
When it dawned on him a while later that he
owed his deliverance equally to both of the gentle
ladies, he kissed Miss Widdington's hand too.
Whereupon Miss Ursula coloured and turned away.
She did not like to see him kiss her sister's hand.
Why, she could not tell, but she felt as if she had
received a tiny stab in the heart.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
Providence has showered many blessings on
Trevannic, but among them is not the gift of tongues.
Dr. Mead, who came over every day from
St. Madoc, knew less German than the ladies.  It
was impossible to communicate with the boy except
by signs.  Old Jan Pendered, who had served in the
navy in the China seas, felt confident that he could
make him understand, and tried him with pidgin-English.
But the youth only smiled sweetly and
shook hands with him, whereupon old Jan scratched
his head and acknowledged himself jiggered.  To
Miss Widdington, at last, came the inspiration that
the oft-repeated word "<i>Polnisch</i>" meant Polish.
</p>

<p>
"You come from Poland?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aus Polen, ya</i>," laughed the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Kosciusko," murmured Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
He laughed again, delighted, and looked at her
eagerly for more; but there Miss Ursula's conversation
about Poland ended.  If the discovery of his
nationality lay to the credit of her sister, she it was
who found out his name, Andrea Marowski, and
taught him to say: "Miss Ursula."  She also
taught him the English names of the various objects
around him.  And here the innocent rivalry of the
two ladies began to take definite form.  Miss
Widdington, without taking counsel of Miss Ursula,
borrowed an old Otto's German grammar from the
girls' school at St. Madoc, and, by means of patient
research, put to him such questions as: "Have you
a mother?"  "How old are you?" and, collating his
written replies with the information vouchsafed by
the grammar, succeeded in discovering, among
other biographical facts, that he was alone in the
world, save for an old uncle who lived in Cracow,
and that he was twenty years of age.  So that when
Miss Ursula boasted that she had taught him to say:
"Good morning.  How do you do?" Miss Widdington
could cry with an air of triumph: "He told me
that he doesn't suffer from toothache."
</p>

<p>
It was one of the curious features of the
ministrations which they afforded Mr. Andrea Marowski
alternately, that Miss Ursula would have nothing
whatever to do with Otto's German grammar and
Miss Widdington scorned the use of English and
made as little use of sign language as possible.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it becoming, Ursula," she said, "to
indicate hunger by opening your mouth and rubbing
the front of your waist, like a cannibal."
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula accepted the rebuke meekly, for she
never returned a pert answer to her senior; but
reflecting that Janet's disapproval might possibly
arise from her want of skill in the art of pantomime,
she went away comforted and continued her
unbecoming practices.  The conversations, however,
that the ladies, each in her own way, managed to
have with the invalid, were sadly limited in scope.
No means that they could devise could bring them
enlightenment on many interesting points.  Who he
was, whether noble or peasant, how he came to be
lying like a jellyfish on the slab of rock in their cove,
coatless and barefoot, remained as great a puzzle as
ever.  Of course he informed them, especially the
grammar-equipped Miss Widdington, over and over
again in his execrable German; but they grew no
wiser, and at last they abandoned in despair their
attempts to solve these mysteries.  They contented
themselves with the actual, which indeed was enough
to absorb their simple minds.  There he was cast up
by the sea or fallen from the moon, young, gay, and
helpless, a veritable gift of the gods.  The very
mystery of his adventure invested him with a
curious charm; and then the prodigious appetite
with which he began to devour fish and eggs and
chickens formed of itself a joy hitherto undreamed
of in their philosophy.
</p>

<p>
"When he gets up he must have some clothes,"
said Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula agreed; but did not say that she was
knitting him socks in secret.  Andrea's interest in
the progress of these garments was one of her chief
delights.
</p>

<p>
"There's the trunk upstairs with our dear father's
things," said Miss Widdington with more diffidence
than usual.  "They are so sacred to us that I was
wondering&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Our dear father would be the first to wish it,"
said Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
"It's a Christian's duty to clothe the naked,"
said Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
"And so we must clothe him in what we've got,"
said Miss Ursula.  Then with a slight flush she
added: "It's so many years since our great loss
that I've almost forgotten what a man wears."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't," said Miss Widdington.  "I think I
ought to tell you, Ursula," she continued, after
pausing to put sugar and milk into the cup of tea
which she handed to her sister&mdash;they were at the
breakfast table, at the head of which she formally
presided, as she had done since her emancipation
from the schoolroom&mdash;"I think I ought to tell you
that I have decided to devote my twenty-five
pounds to buying him an outfit.  Our dear father's
things can only be a makeshift&mdash;and the poor boy
hasn't a penny in the pockets he came ashore in."
</p>

<p>
Now, some three years before, an aunt had
bequeathed Miss Widdington a tiny legacy, the
disposal of which had been a continuous subject of
grave discussion between the sisters.  She always
alluded to it as "my twenty-five pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Is that quite fair, dear?" said Miss Ursula
impulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Fair?  Do you mind explaining?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula regretted her impetuosity.  "Don't
you think, dear Janet," she said with some
nervousness, "that it would lay him under too great an
obligation to you personally?  I should prefer to
take the money our of out joint income.  We both
are responsible for him and," she added with a
timid smile, "I found him first."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what that has to do with it," Miss
Widdington retorted with a quite unusual touch of
acidity.  "But if you feel strongly about it, I am
willing to withdraw my five-and-twenty pounds."
</p>

<p>
"You're not angry with me, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
"Angry?  Of course not," Miss Widdington replied
freezingly.  "Don't be silly.  And why aren't
you eating your bacon?"
</p>

<p>
This was the first shadow of dissension that had
arisen between them since their childhood.  On the
way to the sick-room, Miss Ursula shed a few tears
over Janet's hectoring ways, and Miss Widdington,
in pursuit of her housekeeping duties, made Dorcas
the scapegoat for Ursula's unreasonableness.
Before luncheon time they kissed with mutual apologies;
but the spirit of rivalry was by no means quenched.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IV
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Miss Janet had an inspiration.
</p>

<p>
"If I played the piano in the drawing-room with
the windows open you could hear it in the spare
room quite plainly."
</p>

<p>
"If you think it would disturb Mr. Andrea," said
Miss Ursula, "you might shut the windows."
</p>

<p>
"I was proposing to offer him a distraction, dear,"
said Miss Widdington.  "These foreign gentlemen
are generally fond of music."
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula could raise no objection, but her heart
sank.  She could not play the piano.
</p>

<p>
She took her seat cheerfully, however, by the bed,
which had been wheeled up to the window, so that the
patient could look out on the glory of sky and sea,
took her knitting from a drawer and began to turn
the heel of one of the sacred socks.  Andrea watched
her lazily and contentedly.  Perhaps he had never
seen two such soft-treaded, soft-fingered ladies in
lavender in his life.  He often tried to give some
expression to his gratitude, and the hand-kissing had
become a thrice daily custom.  For Miss Widdington
he had written the word "Engel," which the
vocabulary at the end of Otto's German grammar
rendered as "Angel"; whereat she had blushed
quite prettily.  For Miss Ursula he had drawn,
very badly, but still unmistakably, the picture of a
winged denizen of Paradise, and she, too, had
treasured the compliment; she also treasured the
drawing.  Now, Miss Ursula held up the knitting,
which began distinctly to indicate the shape of a
sock, and smiled.  Andrea smiled, too, and blew her
a kiss with his fingers.  He had many graceful foreign
gestures.  The doctor, who was a plain, bullet-headed
Briton, disapproved of Andrea and expressed
to Dorcas his opinion that the next things to be
washed ashore would be the young man's monkey
and organ.  This was sheer prejudice, for Andrea's
manners were unexceptionable, and his smile, in the
eyes of his hostesses, the most attractive thing in the
world.
</p>

<p>
"Heel," said Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
"'Eel," repeated Andrea.
</p>

<p>
"Wool," said Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
"Vool," said Andrea.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;wo-o," said Miss Ursula, puffing out her
lips so as to accentuate the "w."
</p>

<p>
"Wo-o," said Andrea, doing the same.  And then
they both burst out laughing.  They were enjoying
themselves mightily.
</p>

<p>
Then, from the drawing-room below, came the
tinkling sound of the old untuned piano which had
remained unopened for many years.  It was the
"Spring Song" of Mendelssohn, played, schoolgirl
fashion, with uncertain fingers that now and then
struck false notes.  The light died away from
Andrea's face, and he looked inquiringly, if not
wonderingly, at Miss Ursula.  She smiled encouragement,
pointed first at the floor, and then at him,
thereby indicating that the music was for his
benefit.  For awhile he remained quite patient.  At
last he clapped his hands on his ears, and, his features
distorted with pain, cried out:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein, nein, nein, das lieb' ich nicht!  Es ist
hässlich!</i>"
</p>

<p>
In eager pantomime he besought her to stop the
entertainment.  Miss Ursula went downstairs, hating
to hurt her sister's feelings, yet unable to crush a
wicked, unregenerate feeling of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry, dear Janet," she said, laying her
hand on her sister's arm, "but he doesn't like music.
It's astonishing, his dislike.  It makes him quite
violent."
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington ceased playing and accompanied
her sister upstairs.  Andrea, with an expressive shrug
of the shoulders, reached out his two hands to the
musician and, taking hers, kissed her finger-tips.
Miss Widdington consulted Otto.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lieben Sie nicht Musik?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja wohl</i>," he cried, and, laughing, played an
imaginary fiddle.
</p>

<p>
"He <i>does</i> like music," cried Miss Widdington.
"How can you make such silly mistakes, Ursula?
Only he prefers the violin."
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula grew downcast for a moment; then
she brightened.  A brilliant idea occurred to her.
</p>

<p>
"Adam Penruddocke.  He has a fiddle.  We can
ask him to come up after tea and play to us."
</p>

<p>
She reassured Andrea in her queer sign-language,
and later in the afternoon Adam Penruddocke, a
sheepish giant of a fisherman, was shown into the
room.  He bowed to the ladies, shook the long white
hand proffered him by the beautiful youth, tuned up,
and played "The Carnival of Venice" from start to
finish.  Andrea regarded him with mischievous,
laughing eyes, and at the end he applauded vigorously.
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington turned to her sister.
</p>

<p>
"I knew he liked music," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I play something else, sir?" asked Penruddocke.
</p>

<p>
Andrea, guessing his meaning, beckoned him to
approach the bed, and took the violin and bow
from his hands.  He looked at the instrument critically,
smiled to himself, tuned it afresh, and with
an air of intense happiness drew the bow across the
strings.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he can play it!" cried Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
Andrea laughed and nodded, and played a bit of
"The Carnival of Venice" as it ought to be played,
with gaiety and mischief.  Then he broke off, and
after two or three tearing chords that made his
hearers start, plunged into a wild czardas.  The
ladies looked at him in open-mouthed astonishment
as the mad music such as they had never heard in
their lives before filled the little room with its riot
and devilry.  Penruddocke stood and panted, his
eyes staring out of his head.  When Andrea had
finished there was a bewildered silence.  He nodded
pleasantly at his audience, delighted at the effect
he had produced.  Then, with an artist's malice,
he went to the other extreme of emotion.  He played
a sobbing folk-song, rending the heart with cries
of woe and desolation and broken hopes.  It clutched
at the heart-strings, turning them into vibrating
chords; it pierced the soul with its poignant
despair; it ended in a long-drawn-out note high up in
the treble, whose pain became intolerable; and the
end was greeted with a sharp gasp of relief.  The
white lips of the ruddy giant quivered.  Tears
streamed down the cheeks of Miss Widdington and
Miss Ursula.  Again there was silence, but this time
it was broken by a clear, shrill voice outside.
</p>

<p>
"Encore!  Encore!"
</p>

<p>
The sisters looked at one another.  Who had
dared intrude at such a moment?  Miss Widdington
went to the window to see.
</p>

<p>
In the garden stood a young woman of independent
bearing, with a pallette and brushes in her
hand.  An easel was pitched a few yards beyond the
gate.  Miss Widdington regarded this young woman
with marked disfavour.  The girl calmly raised her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I apologise for trespassing like this," she said,
"but I simply couldn't resist coming nearer to this
marvellous violin-playing&mdash;and my exclamation
came out almost unconsciously."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite welcome to listen," said Miss
Widdington stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask who is playing it?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington almost gasped at the girl's
impertinence.  The latter laughed frankly.
</p>

<p>
"I ask because it seems as if it could only be one
of the big, well-known people."
</p>

<p>
"It's a young friend who is staying with us,"
said Miss Widdington.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," said the girl.  "But, you
see my brother is Boris Danilof, the violinist, so I've
that excuse for being interested."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think Mr. Andrea can play any more
to-day," said Miss Ursula from her seat by the bed.
"He's tired."
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington repeated this information to
Miss Danilof, who bade her good afternoon and
withdrew to her easel.
</p>

<p>
"A most forward, objectionable girl," exclaimed
Miss Widdington.  "And who is Boris Danilof, I
should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
If she had but understood German, Andrea could
have told her.  He caught at the name of the
world-famous violinist and bent eagerly forward in
great excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Boris Danilof?  <i>Ist er unten</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nicht</i>&mdash;I mean <i>Nein</i>," replied Miss Widdington,
proud at not having to consult Otto.
</p>

<p>
Andrea sank back disappointed, on his pillow.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
V
</p>

<p>
However much Miss Widdington disapproved of
the young woman, and however little the sisters
knew of Boris Danilof, it was obvious that they were
harbouring a remarkable violinist.  That even the
bullet-headed doctor, who had played the double
bass in his Hospital Orchestral Society and was,
therefore, an authority, freely admitted.  It gave
the romantic youth a new and somewhat awe-inspiring
value in the eyes of the ladies.  He was a
genius, said Miss Ursula&mdash;and her imagination
became touched by the magic of the word.  As he
grew stronger he played more.  His fame spread
through the village and he gave recitals to crowded
audiences&mdash;as many fisher-folk as could be squeezed
into the little bedroom, and more standing in the
garden below.  Miss Danilof did not come again.
The ladies learned that she was staying in the next
village, Polwern, two or three miles off.  In their
joy at Andrea's recovery they forgot her existence.
</p>

<p>
Happy days came when he could rise from bed
and hobble about on a crutch, attired in the quaint
garments of Captain Widdington, R.N., who had
died twenty years before, at the age of seventy-three.
They added to his romantic appearance, giving him
the air of the <i>jeune premier</i> in costume drama.
There was a blue waistcoat with gilt buttons,
calculated to win any feminine approval.  The ladies
admired him vastly.  Conversation was still
difficult, as Miss Ursula had succeeded in teaching
him very little English, and Miss Widdington, after
a desperate grapple with Otto on her own account,
had given up the German language in despair.
But what matters the tongue when the heart speaks?
And the hearts of Miss Widdington and Miss Ursula
spoke; delicately, timidly, tremulously, in the
whisper of an evening breeze, in undertones, it is
true&mdash;yet they spoke all the same.  The first walks on the
heather of their cliff in the pure spring sunshine were
rare joys.  As they had done with their watches by
his bedside, they took it in turns to walk with him;
and each in her turn of solitude felt little pricklings
of jealousy.  But as each had instituted with him
her own particular dainty relations and
confidences&mdash;Miss Widdington more maternal, Miss Ursula
more sisterly&mdash;to which his artistic nature
responded involuntarily, each felt sure that she was
the one who had gained his especial affection.
</p>

<p>
Thus they wove their gossamer webs of romance
in the secret recess of their souls.  What they
hoped for was as dim and vague as their concept of
heaven, and as pure.  They looked only at the near
future&mdash;a circle of light encompassed by mists;
but in the circle stood ever the beloved figure.
They could not imagine him out of it.  He would
stay with them, irradiating their lives with his
youth and his gaiety, playing to them his divine
music, kissing their hands, until he grew quite strong
and well again.  And that was a long, long way off.
Meanwhile life was a perpetual spring.  Why should
it ever end?
</p>

<p>
One afternoon they sat in the sunny garden, the
ladies busy with needlework, and Andrea playing
snatches of dreamy things on the violin.  The
dainty remains of tea stood on a table, and the young
man's crutch rested against it.  Presently he began
to play Tschaikowsky's "Chanson Triste."  Miss
Ursula, looking up, saw a girl of plain face and
independent bearing standing by the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that, Janet?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Miss Janet glanced round.
</p>

<p>
"It is the impertinent young woman who was
listening the other day."
</p>

<p>
Andrea followed their glances, and, perceiving a
third listener, half consciously played to her.  When
the piece was finished the girl slowly walked away.
</p>

<p>
"I know it's wrong and unchristianlike," said
Miss Widdington, "but I dislike that girl intensely."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said Miss Ursula.  Then she laughed.
"She looks like the wicked fairy in a story-book."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VI
</p>

<p>
The time came when he threw aside his crutch and
flew, laughing, away beyond their control.  This
they did not mind, for he always came back and
accompanied them on their wild rambles.  He now
resembled the ordinary young man of the day as
nearly as the St. Madoc tailors and hosiers could
contrive; and the astonishing fellow, with his
cameo face and his hyacinthine locks, still looked
picturesque.
</p>

<p>
One morning he took Pendruddocke's fiddle and
went off, in high spirits, and when he returned in the
late afternoon his face was flushed and a new light
burned in his eyes.  He explained his adventures
volubly.  They had a vague impression that,
Orion-like, he had been playing his stringed
instrument to dolphins and waves and things some miles
off along the coast.  To please him they said "<i>Ja</i>"
at every pause in his narration, and he thought they
understood.  Finally he kissed their hands.
</p>

<p>
Two mornings later he started, without his fiddle,
immediately after breakfast.  To Miss Ursula, who
accompanied him down the road to the village, he
announced Polwern as his destination.  Unsuspecting
and happy, she bade him good-bye and lovingly
watched his lithe young figure disappear behind the
bounding cliff of the little bay.
</p>

<p>
Miss Olga Danilof sat reading a novel by the door
of the cottage where she lodged when the beautiful
youth came up.  He raised his hat&mdash;she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said in German, "have you told the
funny old maids?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ach</i>," said he, "they are dear, gracious ladies&mdash;but
I have told them."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard from my brother," she remarked,
taking a letter from the book.  "He trusts my
judgment implicitly, as I said he would&mdash;and you
are to come with me to London at once."
</p>

<p>
"To-day?"
</p>

<p>
"By the midday train."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her in amazement.  "But the dear
ladies&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You can write and explain.  My brother's time
is valuable&mdash;he has already put off his journey to
Paris one day in order to see you."
</p>

<p>
"But I have no money," he objected weakly.
</p>

<p>
"What does that matter?  I have enough for the
railway ticket, and when you see Boris he will give
you an advance.  Oh, don't be grateful," she added
in her independent way.  "In the first place, we're
brother artists, and in the second it's a pure matter
of business.  It's much better to put yourself in the
hands of Boris Danilof and make a fortune in Europe
than to play in a restaurant orchestra in New York;
don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
Andrea did think so, and he blessed the storm that
drove the ship out of its course from Hamburg and
terrified him out of his wits in his steerage quarters,
so that he rushed on deck in shirt and trousers,
grasping a life-belt, only to be cursed one moment
by a sailor and the next to be swept by a wave clean
over the taffrail into the sea.  He blessed the storm
and he blessed the wave and he blessed the life-belt
which he lost just before consciousness left him;
and he blessed the jag of rock on the sandy cove
against which he must have broken his ankle; and
he blessed the ladies and the sun and the sea and
sky and Olga Danilof and the whole of this beautiful
world that had suddenly laid itself at his feet.
</p>

<p>
The village cart drew up by the door, and Miss
Danilof's luggage that lay ready in the hall was
lifted in.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said.  "You can ask the old maids
to send on your things."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "I have no things.  I am as free as
the wind."
</p>

<p>
At St. Madoc, whence he intended to send a telegram
to the dear, gracious ladies, they only had just
time to catch the train.  He sent no telegram; and
as they approached London he thought less and less
about it, his mind, after the manner of youth, full of
the wonder that was to be.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VII
</p>

<p>
The ladies sat down to tea.  Eggs were ready to be
boiled as soon as he returned.  Not having lunched,
he would be hungry.  But he did not come.  By
dinner-time they grew anxious.  They postponed the
meal.  Dorcas came into the drawing-room periodically
to report deterioration of cooked viands.
But they could not eat the meal alone.  At last they
grew terrified lest some evil should have befallen
him, and Miss Widdington went in to the village and
despatched Jan Pendered, and Joe Gullow on his
bicycle, in search.  When she returned she found Miss
Ursula looking as if she had seen a ghost.
</p>

<p>
"Janet, that girl is living there."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Polwern.  He went there this morning."
</p>

<p>
Miss Widdington felt as if a cold hand had touched
her heart, but she knew that it behoved her as the
elder to dismiss her sister's fears.
</p>

<p>
"You're talking nonsense, Ursula; he has never
met her."
</p>

<p>
"How do we know?" urged Miss Ursula.
</p>

<p>
"I don't consider it delicate," replied Miss
Widdington, "to discuss the possibility."
</p>

<p>
They said no more, and went out and stood by the
gate, waiting for their messengers.  The moon rose
and silvered the sea, and the sea breeze sprang up;
the surf broke in a melancholy rhythm on the sands
beneath.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds like the 'Chanson Triste,'" said Miss
Ursula.  And before them both rose the picture of the
girl standing there like an Evil Fairy while Andrea
played.
</p>

<p>
At last Jan Pendered appeared on the cliff.  The
ladies went out to meet him.
</p>

<p>
Then they learned what had happened.
</p>

<p>
In a dignified way they thanked Jan Pendered and
gave him a shilling for Joe Gullow, who had brought
the news.  They bade him good night in clear, brave
voices, and walked back very silent and upright
through the garden into the house.  In the drawing-room
they turned to each other, and, their arms
about each other's necks, they broke down utterly.
</p>

<p>
The stranger woman had come and had taken him
away from them.  Youth had flown magnetically to
youth.  They were left alone unheeded in the dry
lavender of their lives.
</p>

<p>
The moonlight streamed through the white-curtained
casement window into the white, spotless
room.  It shone on the two little white beds, on the
white garments, neatly folded on white chairs, on
the white-whiskered gentleman over the mantle-piece,
and on the white faces of the sisters.  They
slept little that night.  Once Miss Widdington
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Ursula, we must go to sleep and forget it all.
We've been two old fools."
</p>

<p>
Miss Ursula sobbed for answer.  With the dawn
came a certain quietude of spirit.  She rose, put on
her dressing-gown, and, leaving her sister asleep,
stole out on tiptoe.  The window was open and the
curtains were undrawn in the boy's empty room.
She leaned on the sill and looked out over the sea.
Sooner or later, she knew, would come a letter of
explanation.  She hoped Janet would not force her
to read it.  She no longer wanted to know whence
he came, whither he was going.  It were better for
her, she thought, not to know.  It were better for
her to cherish the most beautiful thing that had
ever entered her life.  For all those years she had
waited for the prince who never came; and he had
come at last out of fairyland, cast up by the sea.
She had had with him her brief season of tremulous
happiness.  If he had been carried on, against his
will, by the strange woman into the unknown whence
he had emerged, it was only the inevitable ending of
such a fairy tale.
</p>

<p>
Thus wisdom came to her from sea and sky, and
made her strong.  She smiled through her tears, and
she, the weaker, went forth for the first time in her
life to comfort and direct her sister.

STUDIES IN BLINDNESS
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p class="t3b">
AN OLD-WORLD EPISODE
</p>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
I have often thought of editing the diary (which
is in my possession) of one Jeremy Wendover,
of Bullingford, in the county of Berkshire,
England, Gent., who departed this life in the year of
grace 1758, and giving to the world a document as
human as the record of Pepys and as deeply imbued
with the piety of a devout Christian as the
Confessions of Saint Augustine.  A little emendation of
an occasional ungrammatical and disjointed
text&mdash;though in the main the diary is written in the
scholarly, florid style of the eighteenth century; a
little intelligent conjecture as to certain dates; a
footnote now and then elucidating an obscure
reference&mdash;and the thing would be done.  It has
been a great temptation, but I have resisted it.
The truth is that to the casual reader the human side
would seem to be so meagre, the pietistic so full.
One has to seek so carefully for a few flowers of fact
among a wilderness of religious and philosophical
fancy&mdash;nay, more: to be so much in sympathy
with the diarist as to translate the pious rhetoric into
terms of mundane incident, that only to the curious
student can the real life history of the man be
revealed.  And who in these hurrying days would
give weeks of patient toil to a task so barren of
immediate profit?  I myself certainly would not do
it; and it is a good working philosophy of life (though
it has its drawbacks) not to expect others to do
what you would not do yourself.  It is only because
the study of these yellow pages, covered with the
brown, almost microscopic, pointed handwriting,
has amused the odd moments of years that I have
arrived at something like a comprehension of the
things that mattered so much to Jeremy Wendover,
and so pathetically little to any other of the sons and
daughters of Adam.
</p>

<p>
How did the diary, you ask, come into my possession?
I picked it up, years ago, for a franc, at a
second-hand bookseller's in Geneva.  It had the
bookplate of a long-forgotten Bishop of Sodor and
Man, and an inscription on the flyleaf: "John
Henderson, Calcutta, 1835."  How it came into the
hands of the Bishop, into those of John Henderson,
how it passed thence and eventually found its way
to Geneva, Heaven alone knows.
</p>

<p>
I have said that Jeremy Wendover departed this
life in 1758.  My authority for the statement is a
lichen-covered gravestone in the churchyard of
Bullingford, whither I have made many pious
pilgrimages in the hope of finding more records of
my obscure hero.  But I have been unsuccessful.
The house, however, in which he lived, described at
some length in his diary, is still standing&mdash;an Early
Tudor building, the residence of the maltster who
owned the adjoining long, gabled malthouse, and
from whom he rented it for a considerable term of
years.  It is situated on the river fringe of the little
town, at the end of a lane running at right angles to
the main street just before this loses itself in the
market square.
</p>

<p>
I have stood at the front gate of the house and
watched the Thames, some thirty yards away, flow
between its alder-grown banks; the wide, lush
meadows and cornfields beyond dotted here and there
with the red roofs of farms and spreading amid the
quiet greenery of oaks and chestnuts to the low-lying
Oxfordshire hills; I have breathed in the peace
of the evening air and I have found myself very near
in spirit to Jeremy Wendover, who stood, as he notes,
many and many a summer afternoon at that
self-same gate, watching the selfsame scene, far away
from the fever and the fret of life.
</p>

<p>
I have thought, therefore, that instead of publishing
his diary I might with some degree of sympathy
set forth in brief the one dramatic episode in his
inglorious career.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
The overwhelming factor in Jeremy Wendover's
life was the appalling, inconceivable hideousness of
his face.  The refined, cultivated, pious gentleman
was cursed with a visage which it would have pleased
Dante to ascribe to a White Guelph whom he
particularly disliked, and would have made Orcagna
shudder in the midst of his dreams of shapes of hell.
As a child of six, in a successful effort to rescue a
baby sister, he had fallen headforemost into a great
wood fire, and when they picked him up his face
"was like unto a charred log that had long
smouldered."  Almost the semblance of humanity
had been wiped from him, and to all beholders he
became a thing of horror.  Men turned their heads
away, women shivered and children screamed at his
approach.  He was a pariah, condemned from early
boyhood to an awful loneliness.  His parents, a
certain Sir Julius Wendover, Baronet, and his wife,
his elder brother and his sisters&mdash;they must have
been a compassionless family&mdash;turned from him as
from an evil and pestilential thing.  Love never
touched him with its consoling feather, and for love
the poor wretch pined his whole youth long.  Human
companionship, even, was denied him.  He seems
to have lived alone in a wing of a great house,
seldom straying beyond the bounds of the park, under
the tutorship of a reverend but scholarly sot who was
too drunken and obese and unbuttoned to be
admitted into the family circle.  This fellow, one
Doctor Tubbs, of St. Catherine's College, Cambridge,
seems to have shown Jeremy some semblance of
affection, but chiefly while in his cups, "when,"
as Jeremy puts it bitterly, "he was too much like
unto the beasts that perish to distinguish between
me and a human being."  When sober he railed at
the boy for a monster, and frequently chastised him
for his lack of beauty.  But, in some strange way,
in alternate fits of slobbering and castigating, he
managed to lay the groundwork of a fine education,
teaching Jeremy the classics, Italian and French,
some mathematics, and the elements of philosophy
and theology; he also discoursed much to him on
the great world, of which, till his misfortunes came
upon him, he boasted of having been a distinguished
ornament; and when he had three bottles of wine
inside him he told his charge very curious and
instructive things indeed.
</p>

<p>
So Jeremy grew to man's estate, sensitive, shy,
living in the world of books and knowing little, save
at second-hand, of the ways of men and women.
But with all the secrets of the birds and beasts in
the far-stretching Warwickshire park he was
intimately acquainted.  He became part of the
woodland life.  Squirrels would come to him and munch
their acorns on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"So intimate was I in this innocent community,"
says he, not without quiet humour, "that I have been
a wet-nurse to weasels and called in as physician to a
family of moles."
</p>

<p>
When Sir Julius died, Jeremy received his younger
son's portion (fortunately, it was a goodly one) and
was turned neck and crop out of the house by his
ill-conditioned brother.  Tubbs, having also
suffered ignominious expulsion, persuaded him to go on
the grand tour.  They started.  But they only got
as far as Abbeville on the road to Paris, where Tubbs
was struck down by an apoplexy of which he died.
Up to that point the sot's company had enabled
Jeremy to endure the insult, ribaldry and terror
that attended his unspeakable deformity; but, left
alone, he lost heart; mankind rejected him as a pack
of wolves rejects a maimed cub.  Stricken with shame
and humiliation he crept back to England and
established himself in the maltster's house at Bullingford,
guided thither by no other consideration than
that it had been the birthplace of the dissolute Tubbs.
He took up his lonely abode there as a boy of
three-and-twenty, and there he spent the long remainder
of his life.

III
</p>

<p>
The great event happened in his thirty-fourth
year.  You may picture him as a solitary, scholarly
figure living in the little Tudor house, with its
mullioned windows, set in the midst of an old-world
garden bright with stocks and phlox and hollyhocks
and great pink roses, its southern wall generously
glowing with purple plums.  Indoors, the house was
somewhat dark.  The casement window of the main
living-room was small and overshadowed by the
heavy ivy outside.  The furniture, of plain dark oak,
mainly consisted of bookcases, in which were ranged
the solemn, leather-covered volumes that were
Jeremy's world.  A great table in front of the
window contained the books of the moment, the latest
news-sheets from London, and the great brass-clasped
volume in which he wrote his diary.  In
front of it stood a great straight-backed chair.
</p>

<p>
You may picture him on a late August afternoon,
sitting in this chair, writing his diary by the fading
light.  His wig lay on the table, for the weather was
close.  He paused, pen in hand, and looked wistfully
at the mellow eastern sky, lost in thought.  Then
he wrote these words:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>O Lord Jesus, fill me plentifully with Thy love,
which passeth the love of woman; for love of woman
never will be mine, and therefore, O Lord, I require
Thy love bountifully: I yearn for love even as a weaned
child.  Even as a weaned child yearns for the breast of
its mother, so yearn I for love.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He closed and clasped the book with a sigh, put on
his wig, rose and, going into the tiny hall, opened the
kitchen door and announced to his household, one
ancient and incompetent crone, his intention of
taking the air.  Then he clapped on his old
three-cornered hat and, stick in hand, went out of the front
gate into the light of the sunset.  He stood for a
while watching the deep reflections of the alders and
willows in the river and the golden peace of the
meadows beyond, and his heart was uplifted in
thankfulness for the beauty of the earth.  He was a
tall, thin man, with the stoop of the scholar and,
despite his rough, country-made clothes, the
unmistakable air of the eighteenth-century gentleman.
The setting sun shone full on the piteous medley
of marred features that served him for a face.
</p>

<p>
A woman, sickle on arm, leading a toddling child,
passed by with averted head.  But she curtsied and
said respectfully: "Good evening, your honour."  The
child looked at him and with a cry of fear
shrank into the mother's skirts.  Jeremy touched
his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mistress Blackacre.  I trust your
husband is recovered from his fever."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to your honour's kindness," said the
woman, her eyes always turned from him, "he is
well-nigh recovered.  For shame of yourself!" she
added, shaking the child.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay," said Jeremy kindly.  "'Tis not the
urchin's fault that he met a bogey in broad daylight."
</p>

<p>
He strolled along the river bank, pleased at his
encounter.  In that little backwater of the world
where he had lived secluded for ten years folks had
learned to suffer him&mdash;nay, more, to respect him:
and though they seldom looked him in the face their
words were gentle and friendly.  He could even
jest at his own misfortune.
</p>

<p>
"God is good," he murmured as he walked with
head bent down and hands behind his back, "and the
earth is full of His goodness.  Yet if He in His
mercy could only give me a companion in my loneliness,
as He gives to every peasant, bird and beast&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A sigh ended the sentence.  He was young and not
always able to control the squabble between sex and
piety.  The words had scarcely passed his lips,
however, when he discerned a female figure seated on the
bank, some fifty yards away.  His first impulse&mdash;an
impulse which the habit of years would, on
ordinary occasions, have rendered imperative&mdash;was
to make a wide detour round the meadows; but
this evening the spirit of mild revolt took possession
of him and guided his steps in the direction of the
lady&mdash;for lady he perceived her to be when he
drew a little nearer.
</p>

<p>
She wore a flowered muslin dress cut open at the
neck, and her arms, bare to the elbows, were white
and shapely.  A peach-blossom of a face appeared
below the mob-cap bound by a cherry-coloured
ribbon, and as Jeremy came within speaking distance
her dark-blue eyes were fixed on him fearlessly.
Jeremy halted and looked at her, while she looked at
Jeremy.  His heart beat wildly.  The miracle of
miracles had happened&mdash;the hopeless, impossible
thing that he had prayed for in rebellious hours for
so many years, ever since he had realised that the
world held such a thing as the joy and the blessing of
woman's love.  A girl looked at him smilingly,
frankly in the face, without a quiver of repulsion&mdash;and
a girl more dainty and beautiful than any he had
seen before.  Then, as he stared, transfixed like a
person in a beatitude, into her eyes, something
magical occurred to Jeremy.  The air was filled with
the sound of fairy harps of which his own tingling
nerves from head to foot were the vibrating strings.
Jeremy fell instantaneously in love.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me, sir," she said in a musical
voice&mdash;the music of the spheres to Jeremy&mdash;"will you
tell me how I can reach the house of Mistress
Wotherspoon?"
</p>

<p>
Jeremy took off his three-cornered hat and made a
sweeping bow.
</p>

<p>
"Why, surely, madam," said he, pointing with his
stick; "'tis yonder red roof peeping through the
trees only three hundred yards distant."
</p>

<p>
"You are a gentleman," said the girl quickly.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Jeremy Wendover, younger son of
the late Sir Julius Wendover, Baronet, and now
and always, madam, your very humble servant."
</p>

<p>
She smiled.  Her rosy lips and pearly teeth
(Jeremy's own description) filled Jeremy's head with
lunatic imaginings.
</p>

<p>
"And I, sir," said she, "am Mistress Barbara
Seaforth, and I came but yesterday to stay with my
aunt, Mistress Wotherspoon.  If I could trespass so
far on your courtesy as to pray you to conduct me
thither I should be vastly beholden to you."
</p>

<p>
His sudden delight at the proposition was mingled
with some astonishment.  She only had to walk
across the open meadow to the clump of trees.  He
assisted her to rise and with elaborate politeness
offered his arm.  She made no motion, however, to
take it.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I was walking in my aunt's little railed
enclosure," she remarked; "but I must have passed
through the gate into the open fields, and when I
came to the river I was frightened and sat down and
waited for someone to pass."
</p>

<p>
"Pray pardon me, madam," said Jeremy, "but I
don't quite understand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"La, sir! how very thoughtless of me," she laughed.
"I never told you.  I am blind."
</p>

<p>
"Blind!" he echoed.  The leaden weight of a
piteous dismay fell upon him.  That was why she
had gazed at him so fearlessly.  She had not seen
him.  The miracle had not happened.  For a moment
he lost count of the girl's sad affliction in the
stress of his own bitterness.  But the lifelong habit
of resignation prevailed.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I crave your pardon for not having
noticed it," he said in an unsteady voice.  "And I
admire the fortitude wherewith you bear so grievous
a burden."
</p>

<p>
"Just because I can't see is no reason for my
drowning the world in my tears.  We must make the
best of things.  And there are compensations, too,"
she added lightly, allowing her hand to be placed on
his arm and led away.  "I refer to an adventure
with a young gentleman which, were I not blind,
my Aunt Wotherspoon would esteem mightily
unbecoming."
</p>

<p>
"Alas, madam," said he with a sigh, "there you
are wrong.  I am not young.  I am thirty-three."
</p>

<p>
He thought it was a great age.  Mistress Barbara
turned up her face saucily and laughed.  Evidently,
she did not share his opinion.  Jeremy bent a wistful
gaze into the beautiful, sightless eyes, and then saw
what had hitherto escaped his notice: a thin; grey
film over the pupils.
</p>

<p>
"How did you know," he asked, "that I was a
man, when I came up to you?"
</p>

<p>
"First by your aged, tottering footsteps, sir,"
she said with a pretty air of mockery, "which
were not those of a young girl.  And then you
were standing 'twixt me and the sun, and one of
my poor eyes can still distinguish light from
shadow."
</p>

<p>
"How long have you suffered from this great
affliction?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have been going blind for two years.  It is now
two months since I have lost sight altogether.  But
please don't talk of it," she added hastily.  "If you
pity me I shall cry, which I hate, for I want to laugh
as much as I can.  I can also walk faster, sir, if it
would not tire your aged limbs."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy started guiltily.  She had divined his evil
purpose.  But who will blame him for not wishing to
relinquish oversoon the delicious pressure of her little
hand on his arm and to give over this blind flower
of womanhood into another's charge?  He replied
disingenuously, without quickening his pace:
</p>

<p>
"'Tis for your sake, madam, I am walking slowly.
The afternoon is warm."
</p>

<p>
"I am vastly sensible of your gallantry, sir," she
retorted.  "But I fear you must have practised it
much on others to have arrived at this perfection."
</p>

<p>
"By heavens, madam," he cried, cut to the heart
by her innocent raillery, "'tis not so.  Could you
but see me you would know it was not.  I am a
recluse, a student, a poor creature set apart from the
ways of men.  You are the first woman that has
walked arm-in-arm with me in all my life&mdash;except
in dreams.  And now my dream has come true."
</p>

<p>
His voice vibrated, and when she answered hers
was responsive.
</p>

<p>
"You, too, have your burden?"
</p>

<p>
"Could you but know how your touch lightens it!"
said he.
</p>

<p>
She blushed to the brown hair that was visible
beneath the mob-cap.
</p>

<p>
"Are we very far now from my Aunt Wotherspoon's?"
she asked.  Whereupon Jeremy, abashed,
took refuge in the commonplace.
</p>

<p>
The open gate through which she had strayed was
reached all too quickly.  When she had passed
through she made him a curtsey and held out her
hand.  He touched it with his lips as if it were
sacramental bread.  She avowed herself much
beholden to his kindness.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I ever see you again, Mistress Barbara?"
he asked in a low voice, for an old servant was
hobbling down from the house to meet her.
</p>

<p>
"My Aunt Wotherspoon is bed-ridden and receives
no visitors."
</p>

<p>
"But I could be of no further service to you?"
pleaded Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated and then she said demurely:
</p>

<p>
"It would be a humane action, sir, to see sometimes
that this gate is shut, lest I stray through it
again and drown myself in the river."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy could scarce believe his ears.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IV
</p>

<p>
This was the beginning of Jeremy's love-story.
He guarded the gate like Cerberus or Saint Peter.
Sometimes at dawn he would creep out of his house
and tramp through the dew-filled meadows to see
that it was safely shut.  During the day he would do
sentry-go within sight of the sacred portal, and when
the flutter of a mob-cap and a flowered muslin met
his eye he would advance merely to report that the
owner ran no danger.  And then, one day, she bade
him open it, and she came forth and they walked
arm-in-arm in the meadows; and this grew to be a
daily custom, to the no small scandal of the
neighbourhood.  Very soon, Jeremy learned her simple
history.  She was an orphan, with a small competence
of her own.  Till recently she had lived in
Somersetshire with her guardian; but now he was
dead, and the only home she could turn to was that
of her bed-ridden Aunt Wotherspoon, her sole
surviving relative.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy, with a lamentable lack of universality,
thanked God on his knees for His great mercy.  If
Mistress Wotherspoon had not been confined to her
bed she would not have allowed her niece to wander
at will with a notorious scarecrow over the Bullingford
meadows, and if Barbara had not been blind she
could not have walked happily in his company and
hung trustfully on his arm.  For days she was but a
wonder and a wild desire.  Her beauty, her laughter,
her wit, her simplicity, her bravery, bewildered him.
It was enough to hear the music of her voice, to feel
the fragrance of her presence, to thrill at her light
touch.  He, Jeremy Wendover, from whose
distortion all human beings, his life long, had turned
shuddering away, to have this ineffable companionship!
It transcended thought.  At last&mdash;it was
one night, as he lay awake, remembering how they
had walked that afternoon, not arm-in-arm, but
hand-in-hand&mdash;the amazing, dazzling glory of a
possibility enveloped him.  She was blind.  She
could never see his deformity.  Had God listened to
his prayer and delivered this fair and beloved woman
into his keeping?  He shivered all night long in an
ecstasy of happiness, rose at dawn and mounted
guard at Barbara's gate.  But as he waited, foodless,
for the thrilling sight of her, depression came
and sat heavy on his shoulders until he felt that in
daring to think of her in the way of marriage he was
committing an abominable crime.
</p>

<p>
When she came, fresh as the morning, bareheaded,
her beautiful hair done up in a club behind, into the
little field, and he tried to call to her, his tongue was
dry and he could utter no sound.  Accidentally he
dropped his stick, which clattered down the bars of
the gate.  She laughed.  He entered the enclosure.
</p>

<p>
"I knew I should find you there," she cried, and
sped toward him.
</p>

<p>
"How did you know?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"'By the pricking of my thumb,'" she quoted
gaily; and then, as he took both her outstretched
hands, she drew near him and whispered: "and by
the beating of my heart."
</p>

<p>
His arms folded around her and he held her tight
against him, stupefied, dazed, throbbing, vainly
trying to find words.  At last he said huskily:
</p>

<p>
"God has sent you to be the joy and comfort of a
sorely stricken man.  I accept it because it is His will.
I will cherish you as no man has ever cherished
woman before.  My love for you, my dear, is as
infinite&mdash;as infinite&mdash;oh, God!"
</p>

<p>
Speech failed him.  He tore his arms away from
her and fell sobbing at her feet and kissed the skirts
of her gown.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
V
</p>

<p>
The Divine Mercy, as Jeremy puts it, thought fit
to remove Aunt Wotherspoon to a happier world
before the week was out; and so, within a month,
Jeremy led his blind bride into the little Tudor
house.  And then began for him a happiness so
exquisite that sometimes he was afraid to breathe
lest he should disturb the enchanted air.  Every
germ of love and tenderness that had lain undeveloped
in his nature sprang into flower.  Sometimes
he grew afraid lest, in loving her, he was forgetting
God.  But he reassured himself by a pretty sophistry.
"O Lord," says he, "it is Thou only that I
worship&mdash;through Thine own great gift."  And indeed
what more could be desired by a reasonable Deity?
</p>

<p>
Barbara, responsive, gave him her love in full.
From the first she would hear nothing of his maimed
visage.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said as they wandered one golden
autumn day by the riverside, "I have made a picture
of you out of your voice, the plash of water, the
sunset and the summer air.  'Twas thus that my heart
saw you the first evening we met.  And that is more
than sufficing for a poor, blind creature whom a
gallant gentleman married out of charity."
</p>

<p>
"Charity!"  His voice rose in indignant repudiation.
</p>

<p>
She laughed and laid her head on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, dear, I did but jest.  I know you fell in love
with my pretty doll's face.  And also with a little
mocking spirit of my own."
</p>

<p>
"But what made you fall in love with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, Mr. Wendover," she replied, "a woman
with eyes in her head has but to go whither she is
driven.  And so much the more a blind female like
me.  You led me plump into the middle of the
morass; and when you came and rescued me I was
silly enough to be grateful."
</p>

<p>
Under Jeremy's love her rich nature expanded day
by day.  She set her joyous courage and her wit to
work to laugh at blindness, and to make her the
practical, serviceable housewife as well as the gay
companion.  The ancient crone was replaced by a
brisk servant and a gardener, and Jeremy enjoyed
creature comforts undreamed of.  And the months
sped happily by.  Autumn darkened into winter
and winter cleared into spring, and daffodils and
crocuses and primroses began to show themselves
in corners of the old-world garden, and tiny gossamer
garments in corners of the dark old house.  Then a
newer, deeper happiness enfolded them.
</p>

<p>
But there came a twilight hour when, whispering of
the wonder that was to come, she suddenly began to
cry softly.
</p>

<p>
"But why, why, dear?" he asked in tender astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Only&mdash;only to think, Jeremy, that I shall never
see it."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VI
</p>

<p>
One evening in April, while Jeremy was reading
and Barbara sewing in the little candle-lit parlour,
almost simultaneously with a sudden downpour of
rain came a knock at the front door.  Jeremy,
startled by this unwonted occurrence, went himself
to answer the summons, and, opening the door, was
confronted by a stout, youngish man dressed in
black with elegant ruffles and a gold-headed cane.
</p>

<p>
"Your pardon, sir," said the new-comer, "but may
I crave a moment's shelter during this shower?  I am
scarce equipped for the elements."
</p>

<p>
"Pray enter," said Jeremy hospitably.
</p>

<p>
"I am from London, and lodging at the 'White
Hart' at Bullingford for the night," the stranger
explained, shaking the raindrops from his hat.
"During a stroll before supper I lost my way, and
this storm has surprised me at your gate.  I make
a thousand apologies for deranging you."
</p>

<p>
"If you are wet the parlour fire will dry you.  I
beg you, sir, to follow me," said Jeremy.  He led the
way through the dark passage and, pausing with his
hand on the door-knob, turned to the stranger and
said with his grave courtesy:
</p>

<p>
"I think it right to warn you, sir, that I am
afflicted with a certain personal disfigurement which
not all persons can look upon with equanimity."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied the other, "my name is John
Hattaway, surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital in London,
and I am used to regard with equanimity all forms of
human affliction."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hattaway was shown into the parlour and
introduced in due form to Barbara.  A chair was set
for him near the fire.  In the talk that followed he
showed himself to be a man of parts and education.
He was on his way, he said, to Oxford to perform an
operation on the Warden of Merton College.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of operation?" asked Barbara.
</p>

<p>
His quick, keen eyes swept her like a searchlight.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said he, not committing himself, "'tis
but a slight one."
</p>

<p>
But when Barbara had left the room to mull some
claret for her guest, Mr. Hattaway turned to Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a cataract," said he, "I am about to remove
from the eye of the Warden of Merton by the new
operation invented by my revered master,
Mr. William Cheselden, my immediate predecessor at
St. Thomas's.  I did not tell your wife, for certain
reasons; but I noticed that she is blinded by the
same disease."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy rose from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you will restore the Warden's
sight?"
</p>

<p>
"I have every hope of doing so."
</p>

<p>
"But if his sight can be restored&mdash;then my
wife's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can be restored also," said the surgeon complacently.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy sat down feeling faint and dizzy.
</p>

<p>
"Did you not know that cataract was curable?"
</p>

<p>
"I am scholar enough," answered Jeremy, "to
have read that King John of Aragon was so cured by
the Jew, Abiathar of Lerida, by means of a needle
thrust through the eyeball&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Barbarous, my dear sir, barbarous!" cried the
surgeon, raising a white, protesting hand.  "One in
a million may be so cured.  There is even now a
pestilential fellow of a quack, calling himself the
Chevalier Taylor, who is prodding folks' eyes with
a six-inch skewer.  Have you never heard of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, sir," said Jeremy, "I live so out of the world,
and my daily converse is limited to my dear wife and
the parson hard by, who is as recluse a scholar as I
am myself."
</p>

<p>
"If you wish your wife to regain her sight," said
Mr. Hattaway, "avoid this Chevalier Taylor like
the very devil.  But if you will intrust her to my
care, Mr. Hattaway, surgeon of St. Thomas' Hospital,
London, pupil of the great Cheselden&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He waved his hand by way of completing the
unfinished sentence.
</p>

<p>
"When?" asked Jeremy, greatly agitated.
</p>

<p>
"After her child is born."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell her?" Jeremy trembled.
</p>

<p>
"As you will.  No&mdash;perhaps you had better
wait a while."
</p>

<p>
Then Barbara entered, bearing a silver tray, with
the mulled claret and glasses, proud of her blind
surety of movement.  Mr. Hattaway sprang to
assist her and, unknown to her, took the opportunity
of scrutinising her eyes.  Then he nodded
confidently at Jeremy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VII
</p>

<p>
From that evening Jeremy's martyrdom began.
Hitherto he had regarded the blindness of his wife as
a special dispensation of Divine Providence.  She
had not seen him save on that first afternoon as a
shadowy mass, and had formed no conception of his
disfigurement beyond the vague impression
conveyed to her by loving fingers touching his face.
She had made her own mental picture of him, as she
had said, and whatever it was, so far from repelling
her, it pleased her mightily.  Her ignorance indeed
was bliss&mdash;for both of them.  And now, thought
poor Jeremy, knowledge would come with the
restored vision, and, like our too-wise first parents,
they would be driven out of Eden.  Sometimes the
devil entered his heart and prompted cowardly
concealment.  Why tell Barbara of Mr. Hattaway's
proposal?  Why disturb a happiness already so
perfect?  All her other senses were eyes to her.
She had grown almost unconscious of her affliction.
She was happier loving him with blinded eyes than
recoiling from him in horror with seeing ones.  It
was, in sooth, for her own dear happiness that she
should remain in darkness.  But then Jeremy
remembered the only cry her brave soul had ever
uttered, and after wrestling long in prayer he knew
that the Evil One had spoken, and in the good,
old-fashioned way he bade Satan get behind him.
"<i>Retro me, Satanas</i>."  The words are in his diary,
printed in capital letters.
</p>

<p>
But one day, when she repeated her cry, his heart
ached for her and he comforted her with the golden
hope.  She wept tears of joy and flung her arms
around his neck and kissed him, and from that day
forth filled the house with song and laughter and
the mirth of unbounded happiness.  But Jeremy,
though he bespoke her tenderly and hopefully, felt
that he had signed his death-warrant.  Now and
then, when her gay spirit danced through the
glowing future, he was tempted to say: "When you see
me as I am your love will turn to loathing and our
heaven to hell."  But he could not find it in his
heart to dash her joy.  And she never spoke of
seeing him&mdash;only of seeing the child and the sun
and the flowers and the buttons of his shirts, which
she vowed must seem to be sewed on by a drunken
cobbler.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VIII
</p>

<p>
The child was born, a boy, strong and lusty&mdash;to
Jeremy the incarnation of miraculous wonder.  That
the thing was alive, with legs and arms and feet and
hands, and could utter sounds, which it did with
much vigour, made demands almost too great on his
credulity.
</p>

<p>
"What is he like?" asked Barbara.
</p>

<p>
This was a poser for Jeremy.  For the pink brat
was like nothing on earth&mdash;save any other newborn
infant.
</p>

<p>
"I think," he said hesitatingly, "I think he may
be said to resemble Cupid.  He has a mouth like
Cupid's bow."
</p>

<p>
"And Cupid's wings?" she laughed.  "Fie,
Jeremy, I thought we had born to us a Christian
child."
</p>

<p>
"But that he has a body," said Jeremy, "I should
say he was a cherub.  He has eyes of a celestial blue,
and his nose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, his nose?" came breathlessly from Barbara.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, my dear, there is so little of it to
judge by," said Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
"Before the summer's out I shall be able to judge
for myself," said Barbara, and terror gripped the
man's heart.
</p>

<p>
The days passed, and Barbara rose from her bed
and again sang and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"See, I am strong enough to withstand any operation,"
she declared one day, holding out the babe at
arm's length.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Jeremy, "not yet.  The child
needs you."
</p>

<p>
The child was asleep.  She felt with her foot for
its cradle, and with marvellous certainty deposited
him gently in the nest and covered him with the
tiny coverlet.  Then she turned to Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
"My husband, don't you wish me to have my
sight restored?"
</p>

<p>
"How can you doubt it?" he cried.  "I would
have you undergo this operation were my life the
fee."
</p>

<p>
She came close to him and put her hands about his
maimed face.  "Dear," she said, "do you think
anything could change my love for you?"
</p>

<p>
It was the first hint that she had divined his fears;
but he remained silent, every fibre of his being
shrinking from the monstrous argument.  For
answer, he kissed her hands as she withdrew them.
</p>

<p>
At last the time came for the great adventure.
Letters passed between Jeremy and Mr. Hattaway
of St. Thomas' Hospital, who engaged lodgings in
Cork Street, so that they should be near his own
residence in Bond Street hard by.  A great travelling
chariot and post-horses were hired from Bullingford,
two great horse-pistols, which Jeremy had never
fired off in his life, were loaded and primed and put
in the holsters, and one morning in early August
Jeremy and Barbara and the nurse and the baby
started on their perilous journey.  They lay at
Reading that night and arrived without misadventure
at Cork Street on the following afternoon.
Mr. Hattaway called in the evening with two lean
and solemn young men, his apprentices&mdash;for even
the great Mr. Hattaway was but a barber-surgeon
practising a trade under the control of a City
Guild&mdash;and made his preparations for the morrow.
</p>

<p>
In these days of anæsthetics and cocaine, sterilised
instruments, trained nurses and scientific ventilation
it is almost impossible to realise the conditions
under which surgical operations were conducted in
the first half of the eighteenth century.  Yet they
occasionally were successful, and patients sometimes
did survive, and nobody complained, thinking, like
Barbara Wendover, that all was for the best in this
best of all possible worlds.  For, as she lay in the
close, darkened room the next day, after the
operation was over, tended by a chattering beldame of a
midwife, she took the burning pain in her bandaged
eyes&mdash;after the dare-devil fashion of the time
Mr. Hattaway had operated on both at once&mdash;as part
of the cure, and thanked God she was born into so
marvellous an epoch.  Then Jeremy came and sat
by her bed and held her hand, and she was very
happy.
</p>

<p>
But Jeremy then, and in the slow, torturing days
that followed, went about shrunken like a man
doomed to worse than death.  London increased his
agony.  At first a natural curiosity (for he had
passed through the town but twice before, once as
he set out for the grand tour with Doctor Tubbs,
and once on his return thence) and a countryman's
craving for air took him out into the busy streets.
But he found the behaviour of the populace far
different from that of the inhabitants of Bullingford,
who passed him by respectfully, though with averted
faces.  Porters and lackeys openly jeered at him,
ragged children summoned their congeners and
followed hooting in his train; it was a cruel age, and
elegant gentlemen in flowered silk coats and lace
ruffles had no compunction in holding their cambric
handkerchiefs before their eyes and vowing within his
hearing that, stab their vitals, such a fellow should
wear a mask or be put into the Royal Society's
Museum; and in St. James's Street one fine lady,
stepping out of her sedan-chair almost into his arms,
fell back shrieking that she had seen a monster, and
pretended to faint as the obsequious staymaker ran
out of his shop to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
He ceased to go abroad in daylight and only
crept about the streets at night, even then nervously
avoiding the glare of a chance-met linkboy's torch.
Desperate thoughts came to him during these gloomy
rambles.  Fear of God alone, as is evident from the
diary, prevented him from taking his life.  And the
poor wretch prayed for he knew not what.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IX
</p>

<p>
One morning Mr. Hattaway, after his examination
of the patient, entered the parlour where
Jeremy was reading <i>Tillotson's Sermons</i> (there were
the fourteen volumes of them in the room's unlively
bookcase) and closed the door behind him with an
air of importance.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said he, "I bring you good news."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy closed his book.
</p>

<p>
"She sees?"
</p>

<p>
"On removing the bandages just now," replied
Mr. Hattaway, "I perceived to my great regret
that with the left eye my skill has been unavailing.
The failure is due, I believe, to an injury to the
retina which I have been unable to discover."  He
paused and took snuff.  "But I rejoice to inform
you that sight is restored to the right eye.  I
admitted light into the room, and though the vision
is diffused, which a lens will rectify, she saw me
distinctly."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God she has the blessing of sight," said
Jeremy reverently.
</p>

<p>
"Amen," said the surgeon.  He took another
pinch.  "Also, perhaps, thank your humble
servant for restoring it."
</p>

<p>
"I owe you an unpayable debt," replied Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
"She is crying out for the baby," said Mr. Hattaway.
"If you will kindly send it in to her I can
allow her a fleeting glimpse of it before I complete
the rebandaging for the day."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy rang the bell and gave the order.  "And
I?" he inquired bravely.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon hesitated and scratched his plump cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You know that my wife has never seen me."
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, then," said Hattaway.
</p>

<p>
The nurse and child appeared at the doorway, and
the surgeon followed them into Barbara's room.
</p>

<p>
When the surgeon had left the house Jeremy went
to Barbara and found her crooning over the babe,
which lay in her arms.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen him, dear, I've seen him!" she cried
joyously.  "He is the most wonderfully beautiful
thing on the earth.  His eyes are light blue, and
mine are dark, so he must have yours.  And his
mouth is made for kisses, and his expression is that
of a babe born in Paradise."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy bent over and looked at the boy, who
sniggered at him in a most unparadisiacal fashion,
and they talked parentwise over his perfections.
</p>

<p>
"Before we go back to Bullingford you will let me
take a coach, Jeremy, and drive about the streets
and show him to the town?  I will hold him up and
cry: 'Ladies and gentlemen, look!  'Tis the tenth
wonder of the world.  You only have this one
chance of seeing him.'"
</p>

<p>
She rattled on in the gayest of moods, making him
laugh in spite of the terror.  The failure of the
operation in the left eye she put aside as of no
account.  One eye was a necessity, but two were a
mere luxury.
</p>

<p>
"And it is the little rogue that will reap the
benefit," she cried, cuddling the child.  "For, when
he is naughty mammy will turn the blind side of her
face to him."
</p>

<p>
"And will you turn the blind side of your face to
me?" asked Jeremy with a quiver of the lips.
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and pressed it against her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You have no faults, my beloved husband, for me
to be blind to," she said, wilfully or not
misunderstanding him.
</p>

<p>
Such rapture had the sight of the child given her
that she insisted on its lying with her that night, a
truckle-bed being placed in the room for the child's
nurse.  When Jeremy took leave of her before going
to his own room he bent over her and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Her sweet lips&mdash;pathetically sweet below the
bandage&mdash;parted in a smile&mdash;and they never
seemed sweeter to the anguished man&mdash;and she
also whispered, "To-morrow!" and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
He went away, and as he closed the door he felt
that it was the gate of Paradise shut against him for
ever.
</p>

<p>
He did not sleep that night, but spent it as a brave
man spends the night before his execution.  For,
after all, Jeremy Wendover was a gallant gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he went into Barbara's room before
breakfast, as his custom was, and found her still
gay and bubbling over with the joy of life.  And
when he was leaving her she stretched out her hands
and clasped his maimed face, as she had done once
before, and said the same reassuring words.  Nothing
could shake her immense, her steadfast love.  But
Jeremy, entering the parlour and catching sight of
himself in the Queen Anne mirror over the mantle-piece,
shuddered to the inmost roots of his being.
She had no conception of what she vowed.
</p>

<p>
He was scarce through breakfast when Mr. Hattaway
entered, a full hour before his usual time.
</p>

<p>
"I am in a prodigious hurry," said he, "for I must
go post-haste into Norfolk, to operate on my Lord
Winteringham for the stone.  I have not a moment
to lose, so I pray you to accompany me to your wife's
bedchamber."
</p>

<p>
The awful moment had come.  Jeremy courteously
opened doors for the surgeon to pass through,
and followed with death in his heart.  When they
entered the room he noticed that Barbara had caused
the nurse's truckle-bed to be removed and that she
was lying, demure as a nun, in a newly made bed.
The surgeon flung the black curtains from the
window and let the summer light filter through the
linen blinds.
</p>

<p>
"We will have a longer exposure this morning,"
said he, "and to-morrow a little longer still, and so
on until we can face the daylight altogether.  Now,
madam, if you please."
</p>

<p>
He busied himself with the bandages.  Jeremy, on
the other side of the bed, stood clasping Barbara's
hand: stood stock-still, with thumping heart, holding
his breath, setting his teeth, nerving himself for
the sharp, instinctive gasp, the reflex recoil, that he
knew would be the death sentence of their love.
And at that supreme moment he cursed himself
bitterly for a fool for not having told her of his terror,
for not having sufficiently prepared her for the
devastating revelation.  But now it was too late.
</p>

<p>
The bandages were removed.  The surgeon bent
down and peered into the eyes.  He started back in
dismay.  Before her right eye he rapidly waved his
finger.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Barbara.
</p>

<p>
"My God, madam!" cried he, with a stricken
look on his plump face, "what in the devil's name
have you been doing with yourself?"
</p>

<p>
Great drops of sweat stood on Jeremy's brow.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"She can't see.  The eye is injured.  Yesterday,
save for the crystalline lens which I extracted, it
was as sound as mine or yours."
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid something had happened," said
Barbara in a matter-of-fact tone.  "Baby was
restive in the night and pushed his little fist into my
eye."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, madam!" exclaimed the angry
surgeon, "you don't mean to say that you took a
young baby to sleep with you in your condition?"
</p>

<p>
Barbara nodded, as if found out in a trifling
peccadillo.  "I suppose I'm blind for ever?" she asked
casually.
</p>

<p>
He examined the eye again.  There was a moment's
dead silence.  Jeremy, white-lipped and haggard,
hung on the verdict.  Then Hattaway rose,
extended his arms and let them drop helplessly
against his sides.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he.  "The sight is gone."
</p>

<p>
Jeremy put his hands to his head, staggered, and,
overcome by the reaction from the terror and the
shock of the unlooked-for calamity, fell in a faint on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
After he had recovered and the surgeon had gone,
promising to send his apprentice the next day to
dress the eyes, which, for fear of inflammation, still
needed tending, Jeremy sat by his wife's bedside
with an aching heart.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the will of God," said he gloomily.  "We
must not rebel against His decrees."
</p>

<p>
"But, you dear, foolish husband," she cried, half
laughing, "who wants to rebel against them?  Not
I, of a certainty.  I am the happiest woman in
the world."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis but to comfort me that you say it," said
Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the truth.  Listen."  She sought for his
hand and continued with sweet seriousness: "I was
selfish to want to regain my sight; but my soul
hungered to see my babe.  And now that I have seen
him I care not.  Just that one little peep into the
heaven of his face was all I wanted.  And 'twas the
darling wretch himself who settled that I should not
have more."  After a little she said, "Come nearer
to me," and she drew his ear to her lips and
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Although I have not regained my sight, on the
other hand I have not lost a thing far dearer&mdash;the
face that I love which I made up of your voice and
the plash of water and the sunset and the summer
air."  She kissed him.  "My poor husband, how
you must have suffered!"
</p>

<p>
And then Jeremy knew the great, brave soul of that
woman whom the Almighty had given him to wife,
and, as he puts it in his diary, he did glorify God
exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
So when Barbara was able to travel again Jeremy
sent for the great, roomy chariot and the horse-pistols
and the post-horses, and they went back to
Bullingford, where they spent the remainder of their
lives in unclouded felicity.

<h3>
II
<br />
THE CONQUEROR
</h3>

<p>
Miss Winifred Goode sat in her garden
in the shade of a clipped yew, an unopened
novel on her lap, and looked at the gabled
front of the Tudor house that was hers and had been
her family's for many generations.  In that house,
Duns Hall, in that room beneath the southernmost
gable, she had been born.  From that house, save for
casual absences rarely exceeding a month in duration,
she had never stirred.  All the drama, such as it was,
of her life had been played in that house, in that
garden.  Up and down the parapeted stone terrace
walked the ghosts of all those who had been dear to
her&mdash;her father, a vague but cherished memory; a
brother and a sister who had died during her
childhood; her mother, dead three years since, to whose
invalid and somewhat selfish needs she had devoted
all her full young womanhood.  Another ghost
walked there, too; but that was the ghost of the
living&mdash;a young man who had kissed and ridden
away, twenty years ago.  He had kissed her over
there, under the old wistaria arbour at the end of
the terrace.  What particular meaning he had put
into the kiss, loverly, brotherly, cousinly,
friendly&mdash;for they had played together all their young lives,
and were distantly connected&mdash;she had never been
able to determine.  In spite of his joy at leaving the
lethargic country town of Dunsfield for America,
their parting had been sad and sentimental.  The
kiss, at any rate, had been, on his side, one of sincere
affection&mdash;an affection proven afterwards by a
correspondence of twenty years.  To her the kiss
had been&mdash;well, the one and only kiss of her life,
and she had treasured it in a neat little sacred
casket in her heart.  Since that far-off day no man
had ever showed an inclination to kiss her, which, in
one way, was strange, as she had been pretty and
gentle and laughter-loving, qualities attractive to
youths in search of a mate.  But in another way it
was not strange, as mate-seeking youths are rare as
angels in Dunsfield, beyond whose limits Miss
Goode had seldom strayed.  Her romance had been
one kiss, the girlish dreams of one man.  At first,
when he had gone fortune-hunting in America, she
had fancied herself broken-hearted; but Time had
soon touched her with healing fingers.  Of late,
freed from the slavery of a querulous bedside, she
had grown in love with her unruffled and delicately
ordered existence, in which the only irregular things
were her herbaceous borders, between which she
walked like a prim school-mistress among a crowd
of bright but unruly children.  She had asked
nothing more from life than what she had&mdash;her
little duties in the parish, her little pleasures in the
neighbourhood, her good health, her old house,
her trim lawns, her old-fashioned garden, her black
cocker spaniels.  As it was at forty, she thought, so
should it be till the day of her death.
</p>

<p>
But a month ago had come turmoil.  Roger Orme
announced his return.  Fortune-making in America
had tired him.  He was coming home to settle down
for good in Dunsfield, in the house of his fathers.
This was Duns Lodge, whose forty acres marched
with the two hundred acres of Duns Hall.  The two
places were known in the district as "The Lodge"
and "The Hall."  About a century since, a younger
son of The Hall had married a daughter of The
Lodge, whence the remote tie of consanguinity
between Winifred Goode and Roger Orme.  The Lodge
had been let on lease for many years, but now the
lease had fallen in and the tenants gone.  Roger
had arrived in England yesterday.  A telegram had
bidden her expect him that afternoon.  She sat in
the garden expecting him, and stared wistfully at the
old grey house, a curious fear in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, if freakish chance had not brought
Mrs. Donovan to Dunsfield on a visit to the Rector, a
day or two after Roger's letter, fear&mdash;foolish,
shameful, sickening fear&mdash;might not have had so
dominant a place in her anticipation of his
homecoming.  Mrs. Donovan was a contemporary, a
Dunsfield girl, who had married at nineteen and gone
out with her husband to India.  Winifred Goode
remembered a gipsy beauty riotous in the bloom of
youth.  In the Rector's drawing-room she met a
grey-haired, yellow-skinned, shrivelled caricature, and
she looked in the woman's face as in a mirror of
awful truth in which she herself was reflected.  From
that moment she had known no peace.  Gone was
her placid acceptance of the footprints of the years,
gone her old-maidish pride in dainty, old-maidish
dress.  She had mixed little with the modern world,
and held to old-fashioned prejudices which prescribed
the outward demeanour appropriate to each decade.
One of her earliest memories was a homely saying of
her father's&mdash;which had puzzled her childish mind
considerably&mdash;as to the absurdity of sheep being
dressed lamb fashion.  Later she understood and
cordially agreed with the dictum.  The Countess of
Ingleswood, the personage of those latitudes, at the
age of fifty showed the fluffy golden hair and
peach-bloom cheeks and supple figure of twenty; she wore
bright colours and dashing hats, and danced and
flirted and kept a tame-cattery of adoring young
men.  Winifred visited with Lady Ingleswood
because she believed that, in these democratic days, it
was the duty of county families to outmatch the
proletariat in solidarity; but, with every protest of
her gentlewoman's soul, she disapproved of Lady
Ingleswood.  Yet now, to her appalling dismay, she
saw that, with the aid of paint, powder, and peroxide,
Lady Ingleswood had managed to keep young.  For
thirty years, to Winifred's certain knowledge, she
had not altered.  The blasting hand that had
swept over Madge Donovan's face had passed her by.
</p>

<p>
Winifred envied the woman's power of attraction.
She read, with a curious interest, hitherto
disregarded advertisements.  They were so alluring, they
seemed so convincing.  Such a cosmetic used by
queens of song and beauty restored the roses of
girlhood; under such a treatment, wrinkles
disappeared within a week&mdash;there were the photographs
to prove it.  All over London bubbled fountains of
youth, at a mere guinea or so a dip.  She sent for a
little battery of washes and powders, and, when it
arrived, she locked herself in her bedroom.  But the
sight of the first unaccustomed&mdash;and unskilfully
applied&mdash;dab of rouge on her cheek terrified her.
She realised what she was doing.  No!  Ten thousand
times no!  Her old-maidishness, her puritanism
revolted.  She flew to her hand-basin and vigorously
washed the offending bloom away with soap
and water.  She would appear before the man she
loved just as she was&mdash;if need be, in the withered
truth of a Madge Donovan....  And, after all, had
her beauty faded so utterly?  Her glass said "No."  But
her glass mocked her, for how could she conjure
up the young face of twenty which Roger Orme
carried in his mind, and compare it with the present
image?
</p>

<p>
She sat in the garden, this blazing July afternoon,
waiting for him, her heart beating with the love of
years ago, and the shrinking fear in her eyes.
Presently she heard the sound of wheels, and she saw the
open fly of "The Red Lion"&mdash;Dunsfield's chief
hotel&mdash;crawling up the drive, and in it was a man
wearing a straw hat.  She fluttered a timid
handkerchief, but the man, not looking in her direction,
did not respond.  She crossed the lawn to the terrace,
feeling hurt, and entered the drawing-room by the
open French window and stood there, her back to
the light.  Soon he was announced.  She went
forward to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Roger, welcome home."
</p>

<p>
He laughed and shook her hand in a hearty grip.
</p>

<p>
"It's you, Winifred.  How good!  Are you glad
to see me back?"
</p>

<p>
"Very glad."
</p>

<p>
"And I."
</p>

<p>
"Do you find things changed?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," he declared with a smile; "the
house is just the same."  He ran his fingers over the
corner of a Louis XVI table near which he was
standing.  "I remember this table, in this exact
spot, twenty years ago."
</p>

<p>
"And you have scarcely altered.  I should have
known you anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"I should just hope so," said he.
</p>

<p>
She realised, with a queer little pang, that time
had improved the appearance of the man of forty-five.
He was tall, strong, erect; few accusing
lines marked his clean-shaven, florid, clear-cut face;
in his curly brown hair she could not detect a touch
of grey.  He had a new air of mastery and success
which expressed itself in the corners of his firm lips
and the steady, humorous gleam in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You must be tired after your hot train journey,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.  "Tired?  After a couple of
hours?  Now, if it had been a couple of days, as we
are accustomed to on the other side&mdash;&mdash;  But go on
talking, just to let me keep on hearing your voice.
It's yours&mdash;I could have recognised it over a
long-distance telephone&mdash;and it's English.  You've no
idea how delicious it is.  And the smell of the
room"&mdash;he drew in a deep breath&mdash;"is you and the
English country.  I tell you, it's good to be back!"
</p>

<p>
She flushed, his pleasure was so sincere, and she
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"But why should we stand?  Let me take your
hat and stick."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't we sit in the garden&mdash;after my
hot and tiring journey?"  They both laughed.  "Is
the old wistaria still there, at the end of the
terrace?"
</p>

<p>
She turned her face away.  "Yes, still there.  Do
you remember it?" she asked in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I could forget it?  I remember
every turn of the house."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go outside, then."
</p>

<p>
She led the way, and he followed, to the trellis
arbour, a few steps from the drawing-room door.
The long lilac blooms had gone with the spring, but
the luxuriant summer leafage cast a grateful shade.
Roger Orme sat in a wicker chair and fanned himself
with his straw hat.
</p>

<p>
"Delightful!" he said.  "And I smell stocks!  It
does carry me back.  I wonder if I have been away
at all."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you have," said Winifred&mdash;"for
twenty years."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not going away again.  I've had my
share of work.  And what's the good of work just to
make money?  I've made enough.  I sold out before
I left."
</p>

<p>
"But in your letters you always said you liked
America."
</p>

<p>
"So I did.  It's the only country in the world for
the young and eager.  If I had been born there, I
should have no use for Dunsfield.  But a man born
and bred among old, sleepy things has the nostalgia
of old, sleepy things in his blood.  Now tell me about
the sleepy old things.  I want to hear."
</p>

<p>
"I think I have written to you about everything
that ever happened in Dunsfield," she said.
</p>

<p>
But still there were gaps to be bridged in the tale
of births and marriages and deaths, the main
chronicles of the neighbourhood.  He had a surprising
memory, and plucked obscure creatures from the past
whom even Winifred had forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"It's almost miraculous how you remember."
</p>

<p>
"It's a faculty I've had to cultivate," said he.
</p>

<p>
They talked about his immediate plans.  He was
going to put The Lodge into thorough repair, bring
everything up-to-date, lay in electric light and a
central heating installation, fix bathrooms wherever
bathrooms would go, and find a place somewhere for
a billiard-room.  His surveyor had already made his
report, and was to meet him at the house the following
morning.  As for decorations, curtaining, carpeting,
and such-like æsthetic aspects, he was counting
on Winifred's assistance.  He thought that blues and
browns would harmonise with the oak-panelling in
the dining-room.  Until the house was ready, his
headquarters would be "The Red Lion."
</p>

<p>
"You see, I'm going to begin right now," said he.
</p>

<p>
She admired his vitality, his certainty of
accomplishment.  The Hall was still lit by lamps and
candles; and although, on her return from a visit, she
had often deplored the absence of electric light, she
had shrunk from the strain and worry of an innovation.
And here was Roger turning the whole house
inside out more cheerfully than she would turn
out a drawer.
</p>

<p>
"You'll help me, won't you?" he asked.  "I want
a home with a touch of the woman in it; I've lived so
long in masculine stiffness."
</p>

<p>
"You know that I should love to do anything I
could, Roger," she replied happily.
</p>

<p>
He remarked again that it was good to be back.
No more letters&mdash;they were unsatisfactory, after
all.  He hoped she had not resented his business
man's habit of typewriting.  This was in the year
of grace eighteen hundred and ninety-two, and, save
for Roger's letters, typewritten documents came as
seldom as judgment summonses to Duns Hall.
</p>

<p>
"We go ahead in America," said he.
</p>

<p>
"'The old order changeth, yielding place to new.'  I
accept it," she said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"What I've longed for in Dunsfield," he said, "is
the old order that doesn't change.  I don't believe
anything has changed."
</p>

<p>
She plucked up her courage.  Now she would
challenge him&mdash;get it over at once.  She would watch
his lips as he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I must have changed, Roger."
</p>

<p>
"In what way?"
</p>

<p>
"I am no longer twenty."
</p>

<p>
"Your voice is just the same."
</p>

<p>
Shocked, she put up her delicate hands.  "Don't&mdash;it
hurts!"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't have put it that way&mdash;you might
have told a polite lie."
</p>

<p>
He rose, turned aside, holding the back of the
wicker chair.
</p>

<p>
"I've got something to tell you," he said abruptly.
"You would have to find out soon, so you may as well
know now.  But don't be alarmed or concerned.  I
can't see your face."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been stone blind for fifteen years."
</p>

<p>
"Blind?"
</p>

<p>
She sat for some moments paralysed.  It was
inconceivable.  This man was so strong, so alive, so
masterful, with the bright face and keen, humorous
eyes&mdash;and blind!  A trivial undercurrent of thought
ran subconsciously beneath her horror.  She had
wondered why he had insisted on sounds and scents,
why he had kept his stick in his hand, why he had
touched things&mdash;tables, window jambs, chairs&mdash;now
she knew.  Roger went on talking, and she
heard him in a dream.  He had not informed her
when he was stricken, because he had wished to
spare her unnecessary anxiety.  Also, he was proud,
perhaps hard, and resented sympathy.  He had
made up his mind to win through in spite of his
affliction.  For some years it had been the absorbing
passion of his life.  He had won through like many
another, and, as the irreparable detachment of the
retina had not disfigured his eyes, it was his joy to
go through the world like a seeing man, hiding his
blindness from the casual observer.  By dictated
letter he could never have made her understand how
trifling a matter it was.
</p>

<p>
"And I've deceived even you!" he laughed.
</p>

<p>
Tears had been rolling down her cheeks.  At his
laugh she gave way.  An answering choke, hysterical,
filled her throat, and she burst into a fit of sobbing.
He laid his hand tenderly on her head.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, don't.  I am the happiest man alive.
And, as for eyes, I'm rich enough to buy a hundred
pairs.  I'm a perfect Argus!"
</p>

<p>
But Winifred Goode wept uncontrollably.  There
was deep pity for him in her heart, but&mdash;never to be
revealed to mortal&mdash;there was also horrible,
terrifying joy.  She gripped her hands and sobbed
frantically to keep herself from laughter.  A woman's
sense of humour is often cruel, only to be awakened
by tragic incongruities.  She had passed through
her month's agony and shame for a blind man.
</p>

<p>
At last she mastered herself.  "Forgive me, dear
Roger.  It was a dreadful shock.  Blindness has
always been to me too awful for thought&mdash;like being
buried alive."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," he said cheerily.  "I've run a
successful business in the dark&mdash;real estate&mdash;buying
and selling and developing land, you know&mdash;a
thing which requires a man to keep a sharp look-out,
and which he couldn't do if he were buried alive.
It's a confounded nuisance, I admit, but so is gout.
Not half as irritating as the position of a man I once
knew who had both hands cut off."
</p>

<p>
She shivered.  "That's horrible."
</p>

<p>
"It is," said he, "but blindness isn't."
</p>

<p>
The maid appeared with the tea-tray, which she
put on a rustic table.  It was then that Winifred
noticed the little proud awkwardness of the blind
man.  There was pathos in his insistent disregard
of his affliction.  The imperfectly cut lower half of a
watercress sandwich fell on his coat and stayed there.
She longed to pick it off, but did not dare, for fear of
hurting him.  He began to talk again of the house&mdash;the
scheme of decoration.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it all seems so sad!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll not be able to see the beautiful things."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens," he retorted, "do you think I
am quite devoid of imagination?  And do you
suppose no one will enter the house but myself?"
</p>

<p>
"I never thought of that," she admitted.
</p>

<p>
"As for the interior, I've got the plan in my head,
and could walk about it now blindfold, only that's
unnecessary; and when it's all fixed up, I'll have a
ground model made of every room, showing every
piece of furniture, so that, when I get in, I'll know the
size, shape, colour, quality of every blessed thing in
the house.  You see if I don't."
</p>

<p>
"These gifts are a merciful dispensation of Providence."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," said he drily.  "Only they were about
the size of bacteria when I started, and it took me
years of incessant toil to develop them."
</p>

<p>
He asked to be shown around the garden.  She
took him up the gravelled walks beside her gay
borders and her roses, telling him the names and
varieties of the flowers.  Once he stopped and
frowned.
</p>

<p>
"I've lost my bearings.  We ought to be passing
under the shade of the old walnut tree."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right," she said, marvelling at his
accuracy.  "It stood a few steps back, but it was
blown clean down three years ago.  It had been
dead for a long time."
</p>

<p>
He chuckled as he strolled on.  "There's nothing
makes me so mad as to be mistaken."
</p>

<p>
Some time later, on their return to the terrace, he
held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"But you'll stay for dinner, Roger," she exclaimed.
"I can't bear to think of you spending your first
evening at home in that awful 'Red Lion.'"
</p>

<p>
"That's very dear of you, Winnie," he said,
evidently touched by the softness in her voice.  "I'll
dine with pleasure, but I must get off some letters
first.  I'll come back.  You've no objection to my
bringing my man with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course not."  She laid her hand lightly
on his arm.  "Oh, Roger, dear, I wish I could tell
you how sorry I am, how my heart aches for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," he said&mdash;"don't worry a little
bit, and, if you really want to help me, never let me
feel that you notice I'm blind.  Forget it, as I do."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try," she said.
</p>

<p>
"That's right."  He held her hand for a second
or two, kissed it, and dropped it, abruptly.  "God
bless you!" said he.  "It's good to be with you
again."
</p>

<p>
When he was gone, Winifred Goode returned to
her seat by the clipped yew and cried a little, after
the manner of women.  And, after the manner of
women, she dreamed dreams oblivious of the flight
of time till her maid came out and hurried her
indoors.
</p>

<p>
She dressed with elaborate care, in her best and
costliest, and wore more jewels than she would have
done had her guest been of normal sight, feeling
oddly shaken by the thought of his intense imaginative
vision.  In trying to fasten the diamond clasp
of a velvet band round her neck, her fingers trembled
so much that the maid came to her assistance.  Her
mind was in a whirl.  Roger had left her a headstrong,
dissatisfied boy.  He had returned, the romantic
figure of a conqueror, all the more romantic and
conquering by reason of his triumph over the powers
of darkness.  In his deep affection she knew her
place was secure.  The few hours she had passed
with him had shown her that he was a man trained
in the significance not only of words, but also of his
attitude towards individual men and women.  He
would not have said "God bless you!" unless he
meant it.  She appreciated to the full his masculine
strength; she took to her heart his masculine
tenderness; she had a woman's pity for his affliction; she
felt unregenerate exultancy at the undetected crime
of lost beauty, and yet she feared him on account of
the vanished sense.  She loved him with a passionate
recrudescence of girlish sentiment; but the very
thing that might have, that ought to have, that she
felt it indecent not to have, inflamed all her woman's
soul and thrown her reckless into his arms, raised
between them an impalpable barrier against which
she dreaded lest she might be dashed and bruised.
</p>

<p>
At dinner this feeling was intensified.  Roger made
little or no allusion to his blindness; he talked with
the ease of the cultivated man of the world.  He had
humour, gaiety, charm.  As a mere companion, she
had rarely met, during her long seclusion, a man so
instinctive in sympathy, so quick in diverting talk
into a channel of interest.  In a few flashing yet
subtle questions, he learned what she wore.  The
diamond clasp to the black velvet band he
recognized as having been her mother's.  He
complimented her delicately on her appearance, as though
he saw her clearly, in the adorable twilight beauty
that was really hers.  There were moments when it
seemed impossible that he should be blind.  But
behind his chair, silent, impassive, arresting, freezing,
hovered his Chinese body-servant, capped, pig-tailed,
loosely clad in white, a creature as unreal in Dunsfield
as gnome or merman, who, with the unobtrusiveness
of a shadow from another world, served, in the
mechanics of the meal, as an accepted, disregarded,
and unnoticed pair of eyes for his master.  The noble
Tudor dining-room, with its great carved oak
chimney-piece, its stately gilt-framed portraits, its
Jacobean sideboards and presses, all in the gloom of the
spent illumination of the candles on the daintily-set
table, familiar to her from her earliest childhood,
part of her conception of the cosmos, part of her
very self, seemed metamorphosed into the unreal,
the phantasmagoric, by the presence of this
white-clad, exotic figure&mdash;not a man, but an eerie
embodiment of the sense of sight.
</p>

<p>
Her reason told her that the Chinese servant was
but an ordinary serving-man, performing minutely
specified duties for a generous wage.  But the duties
were performed magically, like conjuror's tricks.  It
was practically impossible to say who cut up Roger's
meat, who helped him to salt or to vegetables, who
guided his hand unerringly to the wine glass.  So
abnormally exquisite was the co-ordination between
the two, that Roger seemed to have the man under
mesmeric control.  The idea bordered on the
monstrous.  Winifred shivered through the dinner, in
spite of Roger's bright talk, and gratefully welcomed
the change of the drawing-room, whither the
white-vestured automaton did not follow.
</p>

<p>
"Will you do me a favour, Winnie?" he asked
during the evening.  "Meet me at The Lodge
tomorrow at eleven, and help me interview these
building people.  Then you can have a finger in the
pie from the very start."
</p>

<p>
She said somewhat tremulously: "Why do you
want me to have a finger in the pie?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens," he cried, "aren't you the only
human creature in this country I care a straw about?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that true, Roger?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said he.  After a little span of silence he
laughed.  "People on this side don't say
'sure.'  That's sheer American."
</p>

<p>
"I like it," said Winifred.
</p>

<p>
When he parted from her, he again kissed her hand
and again said: "God bless you!"  She accompanied
him to the hall, where the Chinaman, ghostly
in the dimness, was awaiting him with hat and coat.
Suddenly she felt that she abhorred the Chinaman.
</p>

<p>
That night she slept but little, striving to analyse
her feelings.  Of one fact only did the dawn bring
certainty&mdash;that, for all her love of him, for all his
charm, for all his tenderness towards her, during
dinner she had feared him horribly.
</p>

<p>
She saw him the next morning in a new and yet
oddly familiar phase.  He was attended by his
secretary, a pallid man with a pencil, note-book, and
documents, for ever at his elbow, ghostly, automatic,
during their wanderings with the surveyor through
the bare and desolate old house.
</p>

<p>
She saw the master of men at work, accurate in
every detail of a comprehensive scheme, abrupt,
imperious, denying difficulties with harsh impatience.
He leaned over his secretary and pointed to portions
of the report just as though he could read them, and
ordered their modification.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Withers," he said once to the surveyor, who
was raising objections, "I always get what I want
because I make dead sure that what I want is attainable.
I'm not an idealist.  If I say a thing is to be
done, it has got to be done, and it's up to you or to
someone else to do it."
</p>

<p>
They went through the house from furnace to
garret, the pallid secretary ever at Roger's elbow,
ever rendering him imperceptible services, ever
identifying himself with the sightless man,
mysteriously following his thoughts, co-ordinating his
individuality with that of his master.  He was less
a man than a trained faculty, like the Chinese
servant.  And again Winifred shivered and felt
afraid.
</p>

<p>
More and more during the weeks that followed,
did she realize the iron will and irresistible force of
the man she loved.  He seemed to lay a relentless
grip on all those with whom he came in contact and
compel them to the expression of himself.  Only
towards her was he gentle and considerate.  Many
times she accompanied him to London to the great
shops, the self-effacing secretary shadow-like at his
elbow, and discussed with him colours and materials,
and he listened to her with affectionate deference.
She often noticed that the secretary translated into
other terms her description of things.  This
irritated her, and once she suggested leaving the
secretary behind.  Surely, she urged, she could do
all that was necessary.  He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear," he said very kindly.  "Jukes sees
for me.  I shouldn't like you to see for me in the way
Jukes does."
</p>

<p>
She was the only person from whom he would take
advice or suggestion, and she rendered him great
service in the tasteful equipment of the house and in
the engagement of a staff of servants.  So free a hand
did he allow her in certain directions, so obviously and
deliberately did he withdraw from her sphere of
operations, that she was puzzled.  It was not until
later, when she knew him better, that the picture
vaguely occurred to her of him caressing her tenderly
with one hand, and holding the rest of the world by
the throat with the other.
</p>

<p>
On the day when he took up his residence in the
new home, they walked together through the rooms.
In high spirits, boyishly elated, he gave her an
exhibition of his marvellous gifts of memory, minutely
describing each bit of furniture and its position in
every room, the colour scheme, the texture of
curtains, the pictures on the walls, the knick-knacks on
mantlepieces and tables.  And when he had done,
he put his arm round her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"But for you, Winnie," said he, "this would be
the dreariest possible kind of place; but the spirit
of you pervades it and makes it a fragrant paradise."
</p>

<p>
The words and tone were lover-like, and so was his
clasp.  She felt very near him, very happy, and her
heart throbbed quickly.  She was ready to give her
life to him.
</p>

<p>
"You are making me a proud woman," she murmured.
</p>

<p>
He patted her shoulder and laughed as he released her.
</p>

<p>
"I only say what's true, my dear," he replied, and
then abruptly skipped from sentiment to practical
talk.
</p>

<p>
Winifred had a touch of dismay and disappointment.
Tears started, which she wiped away furtively.
She had made up her mind to accept him,
in spite of Wang Fu and Mr. Jukes, if he should
make her a proposal of marriage.  She had been
certain that the moment had come.  But he made
no proposal.
</p>

<p>
She waited.  She waited a long time.  In the
meanwhile, she continued to be Roger's intimate
friend and eagerly-sought companion.  One day his
highly-paid and efficient housekeeper came to consult
her.  The woman desired to give notice.  Her place
was too difficult.  She could scarcely believe the
master was blind.  He saw too much, he demanded
too much.  She could say nothing explicit, save that
she was frightened.  She wept, after the nature of
upset housekeepers.  Winifred soothed her and
advised her not to throw up so lucrative a post, and,
as soon as she had an opportunity, she spoke to
Roger.  He laughed his usual careless laugh.
</p>

<p>
"They all begin that way with me, but after a
while they're broken in.  You did quite right to tell
Mrs. Strode to stay."
</p>

<p>
And after a few months Winifred saw a change in
Mrs. Strode, and not only in Mrs. Strode, but in all
the servants whom she had engaged.  They worked
the household like parts of a flawless machine.  They
grew to be imperceptible, shadowy, automatic, like
Wang Fu and Mr. Jukes.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
The months passed and melted into years.  Roger
Orme became a great personage in the neighbourhood.
He interested himself in local affairs, served on the
urban district council and on boards innumerable.
They made him Mayor of Dunsfield.  He subscribed
largely to charities and entertained on a sumptuous
scale.  He ruled the little world, setting a ruthless
heel on proud necks and making the humble his
instruments.  Mr. Jukes died, and other secretaries
came, and those who were not instantly dismissed
grew to be like Mr. Jukes.  In the course of time
Roger entered Parliament as member for the division.
He became a force in politics, in public affairs.  In
the appointment of Royal Commissions, committees
of inquiry, his name was the first to occur to
ministers, and he was invariably respected, dreaded,
and hated by his colleagues.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you work so hard, Roger?" Winifred
would ask.
</p>

<p>
He would say, with one of his laughs: "Because
there's a dynamo in me that I can't stop."
</p>

<p>
And all these years Miss Winifred Goode stayed at
Duns Hall, leading her secluded, lavender-scented
life when Roger was in London, and playing hostess
for him, with diffident graciousness, when he
entertained at The Lodge.  His attitude towards her
never varied, his need of her never lessened.
</p>

<p>
He never asked her to be his wife.  At first she
wondered, pined a little, and then, like a brave,
proud woman, put the matter behind her.  But she
knew that she counted for much in his strange
existence, and the knowledge comforted her.  And as
the years went on, and all the lingering shreds of
youth left her, and she grew gracefully into the old
lady, she came to regard her association with him as a
spiritual marriage.
</p>

<p>
Then, after twenty years, the dynamo wore out the
fragile tenement of flesh.  Roger Orme, at sixty-five,
broke down and lay on his death-bed.  One day he
sent for Miss Winifred Goode.
</p>

<p>
She entered the sick-room, a woman of sixty,
white-haired, wrinkled, with only the beauty of a
serene step across the threshold of old age.  He bade
the nurse leave them alone, and put out his hand and
held hers as she sat beside the bed.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a day is it, Winnie?"
</p>

<p>
"As if you didn't know!  You've been told, I'm
sure, twenty times."
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter what other people say?  I
want to get at the day through you."
</p>

<p>
"It's bright and sunny&mdash;a perfect day of early
summer."
</p>

<p>
"What things are out?"
</p>

<p>
"The may and the laburnum and the lilac&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the wistaria?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the wistaria."
</p>

<p>
"It's forty years ago, dear, and your voice is just
the same.  And to me you have always been the
same.  I can see you as you sit there, with your dear,
sensitive face, the creamy cheek, in which the blood
comes and goes&mdash;oh, Heavens, so different from
the blowsy, hard-featured girls nowadays, who could
not blush if&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;I know 'em, although
I'm blind&mdash;I'm Argus, you know, dear.  Yes, I can
see you, with your soft, brown eyes and pale brown
hair waved over your pure brow.  There is a fascinating
little kink on the left-hand side.  Let me feel it."
</p>

<p>
She drew her head away, frightened.  Then
suddenly she remembered, with a pang of thankfulness,
that the queer little kink had defied the years,
though the pale brown hair was white.  She guided
his hand and he felt the kink, and he laughed in his
old, exultant way.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think I'm a miracle, Winnie?"
</p>

<p>
"You're the most wonderful man living," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be living long.  No, my dear, don't
talk platitudes.  I know.  I'm busted.  And I'm
glad I'm going before I begin to dodder.  A seeing
dodderer is bad enough, but a blind dodderer's
only fit for the grave.  I've lived my life.  I've
proved to this stupendous clot of ignorance that is
humanity that a blind man can guide them wherever
he likes.  You know I refused a knighthood.  Any
tradesman can buy a knighthood&mdash;the only knighthoods
that count are those that are given to artists
and writers and men of science&mdash;and, if I could live,
I'd raise hell over the matter, and make a differentiation
in the titles of honour between the great man and
the rascally cheesemonger&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Miss Winifred Goode, "don't
get so excited."
</p>

<p>
"I'm only saying, Winnie, that I refused a
knighthood.  But&mdash;what I haven't told you, what I'm
supposed to keep a dead secret&mdash;if I could live a
few weeks longer, and I shan't, I should be a Privy
Councillor&mdash;a thing worth being.  I've had the
official intimation&mdash;a thing that can't be bought.
Heavens, if I were a younger man, and there were
the life in me, I should be the Prime Minister of this
country&mdash;the first great blind ruler that ever was in
the world.  Think of it!  But I don't want anything
now.  I'm done.  I'm glad.  The whole caboodle is
but leather and prunella.  There is only one thing
in the world that is of any importance."
</p>

<p>
"What is that, dear?" she asked quite innocently,
accustomed to, but never familiar with, his vehement
paradox.
</p>

<p>
"Love," said he.
</p>

<p>
He gripped her hand hard.  There passed a few
seconds of tense silence.
</p>

<p>
"Winnie, dear," he said at last, "will you kiss me?"
</p>

<p>
She bent forward, and he put his arm round her
neck and drew her to him.  They kissed each other
on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"It's forty years since I kissed you, dear&mdash;that
day under the wistaria.  And, now I'm dying, I can
tell you.  I've loved you all the time, Winnie.  I'm
a tough nut, as you know, and whatever I do I do
intensely.  I've loved you intensely, furiously."
</p>

<p>
She turned her head away, unable to bear the
living look in the sightless eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you never tell me?" she asked in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Would you have married me?"
</p>

<p>
"You know I would, Roger."
</p>

<p>
"At first I vowed I would say nothing," he said,
after a pause, "until I had a fit home to offer you.
Then the blindness came, and I vowed I wouldn't
speak until I had conquered the helplessness of my
affliction.  Do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but when you came home a conqueror&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I loved you too much to marry you.  You were
far too dear and precious to come into the intimacy
of my life.  Haven't you seen what happened to all
those who did?"  He raised his old knotted hands,
clenched tightly.  "I squeezed them dry.  I couldn't
help it.  My blindness made me a coward.  It has
been hell.  The darkness never ceased to frighten me.
I lied when I said it didn't matter.  I stretched out
my hands like tentacles and gripped everyone within
reach in a kind of madness of self-preservation.  I
made them give up their souls and senses to me.  It
was some ghastly hypnotic power I seemed to have.
When I had got them, they lost volition, individuality.
They were about as much living creatures to
me as my arm or my foot.  Don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
The white-haired woman looked at the old face
working passionately, and she felt once more the
deadly fear of him.
</p>

<p>
"But with me it would have been different," she
faltered.  "You say you loved me."
</p>

<p>
"That's the devil of it, my sweet, beautiful
Winnie&mdash;it wouldn't have been different.  I should have
squeezed you, too, reduced you to the helpless thing
that did my bidding, sucked your life's blood from
you.  I couldn't have resisted.  So I kept you away.
Have I ever asked you to use your eyes for me?"
</p>

<p>
Her memory travelled down the years, and she was
amazed.  She remembered Mr. Jukes at the great
shops and many similar incidents that had puzzled her.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence.  The muscles of his
face relaxed, and the old, sweet smile came over it.
He reached again for her hand and caressed it
tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"By putting you out of my life, I kept you, dear.
I kept you as the one beautiful human thing I had.
Every hour of happiness I have had for the last
twenty years has come through you."
</p>

<p>
She said tearfully: "You have been very good to
me, Roger."
</p>

<p>
"It's a queer mix-up, isn't it?" he said, after a
pause.  "Most people would say that I've ruined
your life.  If it hadn't been for me, you might have
married."
</p>

<p>
"No, dear," she replied.  "I've had a very full
and happy life."
</p>

<p>
The nurse came into the room to signify the end of
the visit, and found them hand in hand like lovers.
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Nurse," said he, "you see a dying but a jolly
happy old man!"
</p>

<p>
Two days afterwards Roger Orme died.  On the
afternoon of the funeral, Miss Winifred Goode sat in
the old garden in the shade of the clipped yew, and
looked at the house in which she had been born, and
in which she had passed her sixty years of life, and at
the old wistaria beneath which he had kissed her
forty years ago.  She smiled and murmured aloud:
</p>

<p>
"No, I would not have had a single thing different."

<br />
A LOVER'S DILEMMA
</h3>

<p>
"How are you feeling now?"
</p>

<p>
Words could not express the music of
these six liquid syllables that fell through
the stillness and the blackness on my ears.
</p>

<p>
"Not very bright, I'm afraid, nurse," said I.
</p>

<p>
Think of something to do with streams and moonlight,
and you may have an idea of the mellow ripple
of the laugh I heard.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not the nurse.  Can't you tell the difference?
I'm Miss Deane&mdash;Dr. Deane's daughter."
</p>

<p>
"Deane?" I echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know where you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Every thing is still confused," said I.
</p>

<p>
I had an idea that they had carried me somewhere
by train and put me into a bed, and that soft-fingered
people had tended my eyes; but where I was I neither
knew nor cared.  Torture and blindness had been
quite enough to occupy my mind.
</p>

<p>
"You are at Dr. Deane's house," said the voice,
"and Dr. Deane is the twin brother of Mr. Deane, the
great oculist of Grandchester, who was summoned to
Shepton-Marling when you met with your accident.
Perhaps you know you had a gun accident?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it was only that after all," said I, "but
it felt like the disruption of the solar system."
</p>

<p>
"Are you still in great pain?" my unseen hostess
asked sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Not since you have been in the room.  I mean,"
I added, chilled by a span of silence, "I mean&mdash;I
am just stating what happens to be a fact."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said shortly.  "Well, my uncle found
that you couldn't be properly treated at your friend's
little place at Shepton-Marling, so he brought you to
Grandchester&mdash;and here you are."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't understand," said I, "why I should
be a guest in your house."
</p>

<p>
"You are not a guest," she laughed.  "You are
here on the most sordid and commercial footing.
Your friend&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mobray," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mobray settled it with my uncle.  You see
the house is large and father's practice small, as we
keep a nursing home for my uncle's patients.  Of
course we have trained nurses."
</p>

<p>
"Are you one?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  I do the housekeeping.  But I
can settle those uncomfortable pillows."
</p>

<p>
I felt her dexterous cool hands about my head and
neck.  For a moment or two my eyes ceased to ache,
and I wished I could see her.  In tendering my
thanks, I expressed the wish.  She laughed her
delicious laugh.
</p>

<p>
"If you could see you wouldn't be here, and
therefore you couldn't see me anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I ever see you?" I asked dismally.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!  Don't you know that Henry
Deane is one of the greatest oculists in England?"
</p>

<p>
We discussed my case and the miraculous skill of
Henry Deane.  Presently she left me, promising to
return.  The tones of her voice seemed to linger, as
perfume would, in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
That was the beginning of it.  It was love, not at
first sight, but at first sound.  Pain and anxiety stood
like abashed goblins at the back of my mind.  Valerie
Deane's voice danced in front like a triumphant
fairy.  When she came and talked sick-room platitudes
I had sooner listened to her than to the music of
the spheres.  At that early stage what she said
mattered so little.  I would have given rapturous
heed to her reading of logarithmic tables.  I asked
her silly questions merely to elicit the witchery of
her voice.  When Melba sings, do you take count of
the idiot words?  You close eyes and intellect and
just let the divine notes melt into your soul.  And
when you are lying on your back, blind and helpless,
as I was, your soul is a very sponge for anything
beautiful that can reach it.  After a while she gave
me glimpses of herself, sweet and womanly; and
we drifted from commonplace into deeper things.
She was the perfect companion.  We discussed all
topics, from chiffons to Schopenhauer.  Like most
women, she execrated Schopenhauer.  She must have
devoted much of her time to me; yet I ungratefully
complained of the long intervals between her visits.
But oh! those interminable idle hours of darkness, in
which all the thoughts that had ever been thought
were rethought over and over again until the mind
became a worn-out rag-bag!  Only those who have
been through the valley of this shadow can know its
desolation.  Only they can understand the magic of
the unbeheld Valerie Deane.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this?" she asked one
morning.  "Nurse says you are fretful and fractious."
</p>

<p>
"She insisted on soaping the soles of my feet and
tickling me into torments, which made me fractious,
and I'm dying to see your face, which makes
me fretful."
</p>

<p>
"Since when have you been dying?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"From the first moment I heard your voice saying,
'How are you feeling now?'  It's irritating to have
a friend and not in the least know what she is like.
Besides," I added, "your voice is so beautiful that
your face must be the same."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Your face is like your laugh," I declared.
</p>

<p>
"If my face were my fortune I should come off
badly," she said in a light tone.  I think she was
leaning over the foot-rail, and I longed for her nearer
presence.
</p>

<p>
"Nurse has tied this bandage a little too tightly,"
I said mendaciously.
</p>

<p>
I heard her move, and in a moment her fingers
were busy about my eyes.  I put up my hand and
touched them.  She patted my hand away.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't be foolish," she remarked.  "When
you recover your sight and find what an exceedingly
plain girl I am, you'll go away like the others, and
never want to see me again."
</p>

<p>
"What others?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose you're the only patient I have
had to manage?"
</p>

<p>
I loathed "the others" with a horrible detestation;
but I said, after reflection:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about yourself.  I know you are called
Valerie from Dr. Deane.  How old are you?"
</p>

<p>
She pinned the bandage in front of my forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm young enough," she answered with a
laugh.  "Three-and-twenty.  And I'm five-foot-four,
and I haven't a bad figure.  But I haven't any
good looks at all, at all."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said I impatiently, "exactly how you
do look.  I must know."
</p>

<p>
"I have a sallow complexion.  Not very good skin.
And a low forehead."
</p>

<p>
"An excellent thing," said I.
</p>

<p>
"But my eyebrows and hair run in straight
parallel lines, so it isn't," she retorted.  "It is very
ugly.  I have thin black hair."
</p>

<p>
"Let me feel."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  And my eyes are a sort of
watery china blue and much too small.  And my
nose isn't a bad nose altogether, but it's fleshy.
One of those nondescript, unaristocratic noses that
always looks as if it has got a cold.  My mouth is
large&mdash;I am looking at myself in the glass&mdash;my
my teeth are white.  Yes, they are nice and white.
But they are large and protrude&mdash;you know the
French caricature of an Englishwoman's teeth.
Really, now I consider the question, I am the image
of the English <i>mees</i> in a French comic paper."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe it," I declared.
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  I know I have a pretty voice&mdash;but
that is all.  It deceives blind people.  They think
I must be pretty too, and when they see me&mdash;<i>bon
soir, la compagnie</i>!  And I've such a thin, miserable
face, coming to the chin in a point, like a kite.
There!  Have you a clear idea of me now?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, "for I believe you are wilfully
misrepresenting yourself.  Besides, beauty does not
depend upon features regular in themselves, but the
way those features are put together."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mine are arranged in an amiable sort of way.
I don't look cross."
</p>

<p>
"You must look sweetness itself," said I.
</p>

<p>
She sighed and said meditatively:
</p>

<p>
"It is a great misfortune for a girl to be so
desperately plain.  The consciousness of it comes upon
her like a cold shower-bath when she is out with other
girls.  Now there is my cousin&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Which cousin?"
</p>

<p>
"My Uncle Henry's daughter.  Shall I tell you
about her?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not in the least interested in your cousin,"
I replied.
</p>

<p>
She laughed, and the entrance of the nurse put an
end to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Now I must make a confession.  I was grievously
disappointed.  Her detailed description of herself as
a sallow, ill-featured young woman awoke me with
a shock from my dreams of a radiant goddess.  It
arrested my infatuation in mid-course.  My dismay
was painful.  I began to pity her for being so
unattractive.  For the next day or two even her
beautiful voice failed in its seduction.
</p>

<p>
But soon a face began to dawn before me, elusive
at first, and then gradually gaining in definition.  At
last the picture flashed upon my mental vision with
sudden vividness, and it has never left me to this
day.  Its steadfastness convinced me of its accuracy.
It was so real that I could see its expression vary,
as she spoke, according to her mood.  The plainness,
almost ugliness, of the face repelled me.  I thought
ruefully of having dreamed of kisses from the lips
that barely closed in front of the great white teeth.
Yet, after a while, its higher qualities exercised a
peculiar attraction.  A brave, tender spirit shone
through.  An intellectual alertness redeemed the
heavy features&mdash;the low ugly brow, the coarse
nose, the large mouth; and as I lay thinking and
picturing there was revealed in an illuminating flash
the secret of the harmony between face and voice.
Thenceforward Valerie Deane was invested with a
beauty all her own.  I loved the dear plain face as
I loved the beautiful voice, and the touch of her
fingers, and the tender, laughing womanliness, and
all that went with the concept of Valerie Deane.
</p>

<p>
Had I possessed the daring of Young Lochinvar,
I should, on several occasions, have declared my
passion.  But by temperament I am a diffident
procrastinator.  I habitually lose golden moments
as some people habitually lose umbrellas.  Alas!
There is no Lost Property Office for golden moments!
</p>

<p>
Still I vow, although nothing definite was said,
that when the unanticipated end drew near, our
intercourse was arrant love-making.
</p>

<p>
All pain had gone from my eyes.  I was up and
dressed and permitted to grope my way about the
blackness.  To-morrow I was to have my first brief
glimpse of things for three weeks, in the darkened
room.  I was in high spirits.  Valerie, paying her
morning visit, seemed depressed.
</p>

<p>
"But think of it!" I cried in pardonable egotism.
"To-morrow I shall be able to see you.  I've longed
for it as much as for the sight of the blue sky."
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any blue sky," said Valerie.  "It's
an inverted tureen that has held pea-soup."
</p>

<p>
Her voice had all the melancholy notes of the
woodwind in the unseen shepherd's lament in "Tristan
und Isolde."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to tell you," she exclaimed
tragically, after a pause.  "I shan't be here to-morrow.
It's a bitter disappointment.  My aunt in Wales is
dying.  I have been telegraphed for, and I must go."
</p>

<p>
She sat on the end of the couch where I was
lounging, and took my hands.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't my fault."
</p>

<p>
My spirits fell headlong.
</p>

<p>
"I would just as soon keep blind," said I blankly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would say that."
</p>

<p>
A tear dropped on my hand.  I felt that it was
brutal of her aunt to make Valerie cry.  Why could
she not postpone her demise to a more suitable
opportunity?  I murmured, however, a few decent words
of condolence.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Winter," said Valerie.  "I am
fond of my aunt; but I had set my heart on your
seeing me.  And she may not die for weeks and
weeks!  She was dying for ever so long last year, and
got round again."
</p>

<p>
I ventured an arm about her shoulders, and spoke
consolingly.  The day would come when our eyes
would meet.  I called her Valerie and bade her
address me as Harold.
</p>

<p>
I have come to the conclusion that the man who
strikes out a new line in love-making is a genius.
</p>

<p>
"If I don't hurry I shall miss my train," she sighed
at last.
</p>

<p>
She rose; I felt her bend over me.  Her hands
closed on my cheeks, and a kiss fluttered on my lips.
I heard the light swish of her skirts and the quick
opening and shutting of the door, and she was gone.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Valerie's aunt, like King Charles II, was an
unconscionable time a-dying.  When a note from
Valerie announced her return to Grandchester, I had
already gone blue-spectacled away.  For some time
I was not allowed to read or write, and during this
period of probation urgent affairs summoned me to
Vienna.  Such letters as I wrote to Valerie had to be
of the most elementary nature.  If you have a heart
of any capacity worth troubling about, you cannot
empty it on one side of a sheet of notepaper.  For
mine reams would have been inadequate.  I also
longed to empty it in her presence, my eyes meeting
hers for the first time.  Thus, ever haunted by the
beloved plain face and the memorable voice, I
remained inarticulate.
</p>

<p>
As soon as my business was so far adjusted that
I could leave Vienna, I started on a flying visit,
post-haste, to England.  The morning after my arrival
beheld me in a railway carriage at Euston waiting
for the train to carry me to Grandchester.  I had
telegraphed to Valerie; also to Mr. Deane, the
oculist, for an appointment which might give colour
to my visit.  I was alone in the compartment.  My
thoughts, far away from the long platform, leaped
the four hours that separated me from Grandchester.
For the thousandth time I pictured our meeting.  I
foreshadowed speeches of burning eloquence.  I saw
the homely features transfigured.  I closed my eyes
the better to retain the beatific vision.  The train
began to move.  Suddenly the door was opened, a
girlish figure sprang into the compartment, and a
porter running by the side of the train, threw in a
bag and a bundle of wraps, and slammed the door
violently.  The young lady stood with her back to
me, panting for breath.  The luggage lay on the floor.
I stooped to pick up the bag; so did the young lady.
Our hands met as I lifted it to the rack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, don't trouble!" she cried in a voice
whose familiarity made my heart beat.
</p>

<p>
I caught sight of her face, for the first time, and
my heart beat faster than ever.  It was her face&mdash;the
face that had dawned upon my blindness&mdash;the
face I had grown to worship.  I looked at her,
transfixed with wonder.  She settled herself unconcerned
in the farther corner of the carriage.  I took the
opposite seat and leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"You are Miss Deane?" I asked tremulously.
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up, on the defensive.
</p>

<p>
"That is my name," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Valerie!" I cried in exultation.
</p>

<p>
She half rose.  "What right have you to address
me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Harold Winter," said I, taken aback by her
outraged demeanour.  "Is it possible that you don't
recognize me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have never seen or heard of you before in my
life," replied the young lady tartly, "and I hope you
won't force me to take measures to protect myself
against your impertinence."
</p>

<p>
I lay back against the cushions, gasping with
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," said I, recovering; "I am
neither going to molest you nor be intentionally
impertinent.  But, as your face has never been out of
my mind for three months, and as I am travelling
straight through from Vienna to Grandchester to see
it for the first time, I may be excused for addressing
you."
</p>

<p>
She glanced hurriedly at the communication-cord
and then back at me, as if I were a lunatic.
</p>

<p>
"You are Miss Deane of Grandchester&mdash;daughter
of Dr. Deane?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Valerie Deane, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you so."
</p>

<p>
"Then all I can say is," I cried, losing my temper
at her stony heartlessness, "that your conduct in
turning an honest, decent man into a besotted fool,
and then disclaiming all knowledge of him, is
outrageous.  It's damnable.  The language hasn't a
word to express it!"
</p>

<p>
She stood with her hand on the cord.
</p>

<p>
"I shall really have to call the guard," she said,
regarding me coolly.
</p>

<p>
"You are quite free to do so," I answered.  "But
if you do, I shall have to show your letters, in sheer
self-defence.  I am not going to spend the day in a
police-station."
</p>

<p>
She let go the cord and sat down again.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth do you mean?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
I took a bundle of letters from my pocket and
tossed one over to her.  She glanced at it quickly,
started, as if in great surprise, and handed it back
with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I did not write that."
</p>

<p>
I thought I had never seen her equal for unblushing
impudence.  Her mellow tones made the mockery
appear all the more diabolical.
</p>

<p>
"If you didn't write it," said I, "I should like to
know who did."
</p>

<p>
"My Cousin Valerie."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said I.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Valerie Deane and my cousin's name
is Valerie Deane, and this is her handwriting."
</p>

<p>
Bewildered, I passed my hand over my eyes.
What feline trick was she playing?  Her treachery
was incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it was your Cousin Valerie who tended
me during my blindness at your father's house, who
shed tears because she had to leave me, who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quite possibly," she interrupted.  "Only it
would have been at her father's house and not
mine.  She does tend blind people, my father's
patients."
</p>

<p>
I looked at her open-mouthed.  "In the name of
Heaven," I exclaimed, "who are you, if not the
daughter of Dr. Deane of Stavaton Street?"
</p>

<p>
"My father is Mr. Henry Deane, the oculist.  You
asked if I were the daughter of Dr. Deane.  So many
people give him the wrong title I didn't trouble
to correct you."
</p>

<p>
It took me a few moments to recover.  I had been
making a pretty fool of myself.  I stammered out
pleas for a thousand pardons.  I confused myself,
and her, in explanation.  Then I remembered that
the fathers were twin brothers and bore a strong
resemblance one to the other.  What more natural
than that the daughters should also be alike?
</p>

<p>
"What I can't understand," said Miss Deane, "is
how you mistook me for my cousin."
</p>

<p>
"Your voices are identical."
</p>

<p>
"But our outer semblances&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have never seen your cousin&mdash;she left me
before I recovered my sight."
</p>

<p>
"How then could you say you had my face before
you for three months?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid, Miss Deane, I was wrong in that as
in everything else.  It was her face.  I had a mental
picture of it."
</p>

<p>
She put on a puzzled expression.  "And you used
the mental picture for the purpose of recognition?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I.
</p>

<p>
"I give it up," said Miss Deane.
</p>

<p>
She did not press me further.  Her Cousin Valerie's
love affairs were grounds too delicate for her to tread
upon.  She turned the conversation by politely
asking me how I had come to consult her father.  I
mentioned my friend Mobray and the gun accident.
She remembered the case and claimed a slight
acquaintance with Mobray, whom she had met at
various houses in Grandchester.  My credit as a
sane and reputable person being established, we
began to chat most amicably.  I found Miss Deane
an accomplished woman.  We talked books, art,
travel.  She had the swift wit which delights in
bridging the trivial and the great.  She had a
playful fancy.  Never have I found a personality so
immediately sympathetic.  I told her a sad little
Viennese story in which I happened to have played a
minor part, and her tenderness was as spontaneous as
Valerie's&mdash;my Valerie's.  She had Valerie's woodland
laugh.  Were it not that her personal note, her
touch on the strings of life differed essentially from
my beloved's, I should have held it grotesquely
impossible for any human being but Valerie to be sitting
in the opposite corner of that railway carriage.
Indeed there were moments when she was Valerie,
when the girl waiting for me at Grandchester faded
into the limbo of unreal things.  A kiss from those
lips had fluttered on mine.  It were lunacy to doubt it.
</p>

<p>
During intervals of non-illusion I examined her
face critically.  There was no question of its
unattractiveness to the casual observer.  The nose was
too large and fleshy, the teeth too prominent, the
eyes too small.  But my love had pierced to its
underlying spirituality, and it was the face above all
others that I desired.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of a remarkably short four hours'
journey, Miss Deane graciously expressed the hope
that we might meet again.
</p>

<p>
"I shall ask Valerie," said I, "to present me in
due form."
</p>

<p>
She smiled maliciously.  "Are you quite sure you
will be able to distinguish one from the other when
my cousin and I are together?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you, then, so identically alike?"
</p>

<p>
"That's a woman's way of answering a question&mdash;by
another question," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but are you?" I persisted.
</p>

<p>
"How otherwise could you have mistaken me for
her?" She had drawn off her gloves, so as to give
a tidying touch to her hair.  I noticed her hands,
small, long, and deft.  I wondered whether they
resembled Valerie's.
</p>

<p>
"Would you do me the great favour of letting me
touch your hand while I shut my eyes, as if I were
blind?"
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand frankly.  My fingers ran
over it for a few seconds, as they had done many
times over Valerie's.  "Well?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not the same," said I.
</p>

<p>
She flushed, it seemed angrily, and glanced down
at her hand, on which she immediately proceeded to
draw a glove.
</p>

<p>
"Yours are stronger.  And finer," I added, when
I saw that the tribute of strength did not please.
</p>

<p>
"It's the one little personal thing I am proud of,"
she remarked.
</p>

<p>
"You have made my four hours pass like four
minutes," said I.  "A service to a fellow-creature
which you might take some pride in having performed."
</p>

<p>
"When I was a child I could have said the same of
performing elephants."
</p>

<p>
"I am no longer a child, Miss Deane," said I with
a bow.
</p>

<p>
What there was in this to make the blood rush to
her pale cheeks I do not know.  The ways of women
have often surprised me.  I have heard other men
make a similar confession.
</p>

<p>
"I think most men are children," she said shortly.
</p>

<p>
"In what way?"
</p>

<p>
"Their sweet irresponsibility," said Miss Deane.
</p>

<p>
And then the train entered Grandchester Station.
</p>

<p>
I deposited my bag at the station hotel and drove
straight to Stavaton Street.  I forgot Miss Deane.
My thoughts and longings centred in her beloved
counterpart, with her tender, caressing ways, and
just a subtle inflection in the voice that made it
more exquisite than the voice to which I had been
listening.
</p>

<p>
The servant who opened the door recognized me
and smiled a welcome.  Miss Valerie was in the
drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"I know the way," said I.
</p>

<p>
Impetuous, I ran up the stairs, burst into the
drawing-room, and stopped short on the threshold in
presence of a strange and exceedingly beautiful
young woman.  She was stately and slender.  She
had masses of bright brown hair waving over a
beautiful brow.  She had deep sapphire eyes, like
stars.  She had the complexion of a Greuze child.
She had that air of fairy diaphaneity combined with
the glow of superb health which makes the typical
loveliness of the Englishwoman.  I gaped for a
second or two at this gracious apparition.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," said I; "I was told&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The apparition who was standing by the fireplace
smiled and came forward with extended hands.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Harold!  Of course you were told.  It is
all right.  I am Valerie."
</p>

<p>
I blinked; the world seemed upside down; the
enchanting voice rang in my ears, but it harmonized
in no way with the equally enchanting face.  I
put out my hand.  "How do you do?" I said
stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"But aren't you glad to see me?" asked the
lovely young woman.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said I; "I came from Vienna to see you."
</p>

<p>
"But you look disappointed."
</p>

<p>
"The fact is," I stammered, "I expected to see
some one different&mdash;quite different.  The face you
described has been haunting me for three months."
</p>

<p>
She had the effrontery to laugh.  Her eyes danced
mischief.
</p>

<p>
"Did you really think me such a hideous fright?"
</p>

<p>
"You were not a fright at all," said I, remembering
my late travelling companion.
</p>

<p>
And then in a flash I realised what she had done.
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth did you describe your cousin
instead of yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"My cousin!  How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," I answered.  "You did.  During
your description you had her face vividly before your
mind.  The picture was in some telepathic way
transferred from your brain to mine, and there it
remained.  The proof is that when I saw a certain
lady to-day I recognised her at once and greeted her
effusively as Valerie.  Her name did happen to be
Valerie, and Valerie Deane too, and I ran the risk
of a police-station&mdash;and I don't think it was fair of
you.  What prompted you to deceive me?"
</p>

<p>
I was hurt and angry, and I spoke with some
acerbity.  Valerie drew herself up with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"If you claim an explanation, I will give it to you.
We have had young men patients in the house before,
and, as they had nothing to do, they have amused
themselves and annoyed me by falling in love with
me.  I was tired of it, and decided that it shouldn't
happen in your case.  So I gave a false description
of myself.  To make it consistent, I took a real
person for a model."
</p>

<p>
"So you were fooling me all the time?" said I,
gathering hat and stick.
</p>

<p>
Her face softened adorably.  Her voice had the
tones of the wood-wind.
</p>

<p>
"Not all the time, Harold," she said.
</p>

<p>
I laid down hat and stick.
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you not undeceive me afterward?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought," she said, blushing and giving me a
fleeting glance, "well, I thought you&mdash;you wouldn't
be sorry to find I wasn't&mdash;bad looking."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, Valerie," said I, "and that's the
mischief of it."
</p>

<p>
"I was so looking forward to your seeing me," she
said tearfully.  And then, with sudden petulance, she
stamped her small foot.  "It is horrid of
you&mdash;perfectly horrid&mdash;and I never want to speak to you
again."  The last word ended in a sob.  She rushed
to the door, pushed me aside, as I endeavoured to
stop her, and fled in a passion of tears.  <i>Spretæ
injuria formæ</i>!  Women have remained much the
same since the days of Juno.
</p>

<p>
A miserable, remorseful being, I wandered through
the Grandchester streets, to keep my appointment
with Mr. Henry Deane.  After a short interview he
dismissed me with a good report of my eyes.  Miss
Deane, dressed for walking, met me in the hall as the
servant was showing me out, and we went together
into the street.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said with a touch of irony, "have you
seen my cousin?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think her like me?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to Heaven she were!" I exclaimed fervently.
"I shouldn't be swirling round in a sort of
maelstrom."
</p>

<p>
She looked steadily at me&mdash;I like her downrightness.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind telling me what you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I am in love with the personality of one woman
and the face of another.  And I never shall fall out
of love with the face."
</p>

<p>
"And the personality?"
</p>

<p>
"God knows," I groaned.
</p>

<p>
"I never conceived it possible for any man to fall
in love with a face so hopelessly unattractive," she
said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"It is beautiful," I cried.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me queerly for a few seconds, during
which I had the sensation of something odd, uncanny
having happened.  I was fascinated.  I found myself
saying: "What did you mean by the 'sweet
irresponsibility of man'?"
</p>

<p>
She put out her hand abruptly and said good-bye.
I watched her disappear swiftly round a near corner,
and I went, my head buzzing with her, back to my
hotel.  In the evening I dined with Dr. Deane.  I
had no opportunity of seeing Valerie alone.  In a
whisper she begged forgiveness.  I relented.  Her
beauty and charm would have mollified a cross
rhinoceros.  The love in her splendid eyes would
have warmed a snow image.  The pressure of her
hand at parting brought back the old Valerie, and
I knew I loved her desperately.  But inwardly I
groaned, because she had not the face of my dreams.
I hated her beauty.  As soon as the front door closed
behind me, my head began to buzz again with the
other Valerie.
</p>

<p>
I lay awake all night.  The two Valeries wove
themselves inextricably together in my hopes and
longings.  I worshipped a composite chimera.
When the grey dawn stole through my bedroom
window, the chimera vanished, but a grey dubiety
dawned upon my soul.  Day invested it with a
ghastly light.  I rose a shivering wreck and fled
from Grandchester by the first train.
</p>

<p>
I have not been back to Grandchester.  I am in
Vienna, whither I returned as fast as the Orient
Express could carry me.  I go to bed praying that
night will dispel my doubt.  I wake every morning
to my adamantine indecision.  That I am consuming
away with love for one of the two Valeries is the
only certain fact in my uncertain existence.  But
which of the Valeries it is I cannot for the life of me
decide.
</p>

<p>
If any woman (it is beyond the wit of man) could
solve my problem and save me from a hopeless and
lifelong celibacy she would earn my undying gratitude.

<h3>
IV
<br />
A WOMAN OF THE WAR
</h3>

<p>
It was a tiny room at the top of what used to be a
princely London mansion, the home of a great
noble&mdash;a tiny room, eight feet by five, the
sleeping-receptacle, in the good old days, for some
unconsidered scullery-maid or under-footman.  The
walls were distempered and bare; the furniture
consisted of a camp-bed, a chair, a deal chest of drawers,
and a wash-stand&mdash;everything spotless.  There was
no fireplace.  An aerial cell of a room, yet the woman
in nurse's uniform who sat on the bed pressing her
hands to burning eyes and aching brows thanked
God for it.  She thanked God for the privacy of it.
Had she been a mere nurse, she would have had the
third share of a large, comfortable bedroom, with a
fire on bitter winter nights.  But, as a Sister, she
had a room to herself.  Thank God she was alone!
Coldly, stonily, silently alone.
</p>

<p>
The expected convoy of wounded officers had been
late, and she had remained on duty beyond her hour,
so as to lend a hand.  Besides, she was not on the
regular staff of the private hospital.  She had broken
a much needed rest from France to give temporary
relief from pressure; so an extra hour or two did not
matter.
</p>

<p>
The ambulances at length arrived.  Some
stretcher-cases, some walking.  Among the latter
was one, strongly knit, athletic, bandaged over the
entire head and eyes, and led like a blind man by
orderlies.  When she first saw him in the vestibule,
his humorous lips and resolute chin, which were all
of his face unhidden, seemed curiously familiar;
but during the bustle of installation, the half-flash
of memory became extinct.  It was only later, when
she found that this head-bandaged man was assigned
to her care, that she again took particular notice of
him.  Now that his overcoat had been taken off,
she saw a major's crown on the sleeve of his tunic,
and on the breast the ribbons of the D.S.O. and the
M.C.  He was talking to the matron.
</p>

<p>
"They did us proud all the way.  Had an excellent
dinner.  It's awfully kind of you; but I
want nothing more, I assure you, save just to get
into bed and sleep like a dog."
</p>

<p>
And then she knew, in a sudden electric shock of
certainty.
</p>

<p>
Half dazed, she heard the matron say,
</p>

<p>
"Sister, this is Major Shileto, of the Canadian
army."
</p>

<p>
Half dazed, too, she took his gropingly outstretched
hand.  The gesture, wide of the mark, struck her
with terror.  She controlled herself.  The matron
consulted her typed return-sheet and ran off the
medical statement of his injuries.
</p>

<p>
Major Shileto laughed.
</p>

<p>
"My hat!  If I've got all that the matter with me,
why didn't they bury me decently in France?"
</p>

<p>
She was rent by the gay laughter.  When the
matron turned away, she followed her.
</p>

<p>
"He isn't blind, is he?"
</p>

<p>
The matron, to whose naturally thin, pinched face
worry and anxiety had added a touch of shrewishness,
swung round on her.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were a medical student.  Is there
anything about blindness here?"  She smote the
typed pages.  "Of course not!"
</p>

<p>
The night staff being on duty, she had then fled
the ward and mounted up the many stairs to the
little room where she now sat, her hands to her eyes.
Thank God he was not blind, and thank God she
was alone!
</p>

<p>
But it had all happened a hundred years ago.
Well, twenty years at least.  In some vague period
of folly before the war.  Yet, after all, she was only
five and twenty.  When did it happen?  She began
an agonized calculation of dates&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She had striven almost successfully to put the
miserable episode out of her mind, to regard that
period of her life as a phase of a previous existence.
Since the war began, carried on the flood-tide of
absorbing work, she had had no time to moralize on
the past.  When it came before her in odd moments,
she had sent it packing into the limbo of deformed
and hateful things.  And now the man with the
gay laughter and the distinguished soldier's record
had brought it all back, horribly vivid.  For the
scared moments, it was as though the revolutionary
war-years had never been.  She saw herself again
the Camilla Warrington whom she had sought
contemptuously to bury.
</p>

<p>
Had there been but a musk grain of beauty in that
Camilla's story, she would have cherished the fragrance;
but it had all been so ignoble and stupid.  It
had begun with her clever girlhood.  The London
University matriculation.  The first bachelor-of-science
degree.  John Donovan, the great surgeon,
a friend of her parents, had encouraged her
ambitions toward a medical career.  She became a
student at the Royal Free Hospital, of the consulting
staff of which John Donovan was a member.
For the first few months, all went well.  She boarded
near by, in Bloomsbury, with a vague sort of aunt
and distant cousins, folks of unimpeachable repute.
Then, fired by the independent theories and habits
of a couple of fellow students, she left the home of
dull respectability and joined them in the slatternly
bohemia of a Chelsea slum.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there was excuse for her youthful ardency to
know all that there was to be known in the world at
once!  But if she had used her excellent brains,
she would have realized that all that is to be known
in the world could not be learned in her new
environment.  The unholy crew&mdash;they called it "The
Brotherhood"&mdash;into which she plunged consisted
of the dregs of a decadent art-world, unclean in
person and in ethics.  At first, she revolted.  But the
specious intellectuality of the crew fascinated her.
Hitherto, she had seen life purely from the scientific
angle.  Material cause, material effect.  On material
life, art but an excrescence.  She had been carelessly
content to regard it merely as an interpretation
of Beauty&mdash;to her, almost synonymous with
prettiness.
</p>

<p>
At the various meeting-places of the crew, who
talked with the interminability of a Russian Bolshevik,
she learned a surprising lot of things about art
that had never entered into her philosophy.  She
learned, or tried to learn&mdash;though her intelligence
boggled fearfully at it&mdash;that the most vital thing
in existence was the decomposition of phenomena,
into interesting planes.  All things in nature were
in motion&mdash;as a scientific truth, she was inclined
to accept the proposition; but the proclaimed fact
that the representation of the Lucretian theory of
fluidity by pictorial diagrams of intersecting planes
was destined to revolutionize human society was
beyond her comprehension.  Still, it was vastly
interesting.  They got their plane-system into
sculpture, into poetry, in some queer way into sociology.
</p>

<p>
A dingy young painter, meagerly hirsute, and a
pallid young woman of anarchical politics assembled
the crew one evening and, taking hands, announced
the fact of their temporary marriage.  The
temporary bridegroom made a speech which was
enthusiastically acclaimed.  Their association was
connected (so Camilla understood) with some sublime
quality inherent in the intersecting planes.  In
these various pairings gleamed none of the old Latin
Quarter joyousness.  Their immorality was most
austere.
</p>

<p>
To Camilla, it was all new and startling&mdash;a
phantasmagorical world.  Free love the merest
commonplace.  And, after a short while, into this
poisonous atmosphere wherein she dwelt there came
two influences.  One was the vigilancy of the
Women's Social and Political Union; the other,
Harry Shileto, a young architect, a healthy man in
the midst of an unhealthy tribe.
</p>

<p>
First, young Shileto.  It is not that he differed
much from the rest of the crew in crazy theory.  He
maintained, like everyone else, that Raphael and
Brunelleschi had retarded the progress of the world
for a thousand years; he despised Debussy for a
half-hearted anarchist; he lamented the failure of
the architectural iconoclasts of the late 'Nineties;
his professed contempt for all human activities
outside the pale of the slum was colossal; on the
slum marriage-theory he was sound, nay, enthusiastic.
But he was physically clean, physically
good-looking, a man.  And as Camilla, too, practised
cleanliness of person, they were drawn together.
</p>

<p>
And, at the same time, the cold, relentless hand of
the great feminist organization got her in its grip.
Blindly acting under orders, she interrupted
meetings, broke windows, went to prison, shrieked at
street-corners the independence of her sex.  And
then she came down on the bed-rock of a sex by no
means so independent&mdash;on the contrary, imperiously,
tyrannically dependent on hers.  The theories
of the slum, uncompromisingly suffragist, were all
very well; they might be practised with impunity
by the anemic and slatternly; but when Harry
Shileto entered into the quasi-marriage bond with
Camilla, the instinct of the honest Briton clamored
for the comforts of a home.  As all the time that
she could spare from the neglect of her studies at
the hospital was devoted to feminist rioting, and a
mere rag of a thing came back at night to the
uncared-for flat, the young man rebelled.
</p>

<p>
"You can't love and look after me and fool about
in prison at the same time.  The two things don't
hold together."
</p>

<p>
And Camilla, her nerves a jangle,
</p>

<p>
"I am neither your odalisk nor your housekeeper;
so your remark does not apply."
</p>

<p>
Oh, the squalid squabbles!  And then, at last,
</p>

<p>
"Camilla"&mdash;he gave her a letter to read&mdash;"I'm
fed up with all this rot."
</p>

<p>
She glanced over the letter.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to accept this post in Canada?"
she asked sourly.
</p>

<p>
"Not if you promise to chuck the militant
business and also these epicene freaks in Chelsea.  I
should like you to carry on at the hospital until
you're qualified."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to forget," she said, "that I'm like a
soldier under orders.  If necessary, I must sacrifice
my medical career.  I also think your remarks about
The Brotherhood simply beastly.  I'll do no such
thing."
</p>

<p>
Eventually it came to this:
</p>

<p>
"I don't care whether women get the vote or not.
I think our Chelsea friends are the most pestilential
set of rotters on the face of the earth.  I've got my
way to make in the world.  Help me to do it.  Let
us get married in decent fashion and go out together."
</p>

<p>
"I being just the appanage of the rising young
architect?  Thank you for the insult."
</p>

<p>
And so the argument went on until he delivered his
ultimatum:
</p>

<p>
"If I don't get a sensible message by twelve o'clock
to-morrow at the club, I'll never see or hear of you
as long as I live."
</p>

<p>
He went out of the flat.  She sent no message.
He did not return.  After a while, a lawyer came
and equitably adjusted joint financial responsibilities.
And that was the end of the romance&mdash;if romance
it could be termed.  From that day to this, Harry
Shileto had vanished from her ken.
</p>

<p>
His exit had been the end of the romance; but it
had marked the beginning of tragedy.  A man can
love and, however justifiably, ride away&mdash;gloriously
free.  But the woman, for all her clamoring
insistence, has to pay the debt from which man is
physically exempt.  Harry Shileto had already
arrived in Canada when Camilla discovered the
dismaying fact of her sex's disability.  But her pride
kept her silent, and of the child born in secret and
dead within a fortnight, Harry Shileto never heard.
Then, after a few months of dejection and loss of
bearings and lassitude, the war thundered on the
world.  Her friend, John Donovan, the surgeon, was
going out to France.  She went to him and said:
"I've wasted my time.  It will take years for me to
qualify.  Let me go out and nurse."  So, through
his influence, she had stepped into the midst of the
suffering of the war, and there she still remained and
found great happiness in great work.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At length she drew her hands from her brow and
went and poured out some water, for her throat was
parched.  On catching sight of herself in the mirror,
she paused.  She was pale and worn, and there were
hollows beneath her eyes, catching shadows, but the
war had not altogether marred her face.  She took
off her uniform-cap and revealed dark hair, full and
glossy.  She half wondered why the passage of a
hundred years had not turned it white.  Then
she sat again on the bed and gripped her hands
together.
</p>

<p>
"My God, what am I going to do?"
</p>

<p>
Had she loved him?  She did not know.  Her
association with him could not have been entirely the
callous execution of a social theory.  There must
have been irradiating gleams.  Or had she wilfully
excluded them from her soul?  Once she had needed
him and cried for him; but that was in an hour of
weakness which she had conquered.  And now, how
could she face him?  Still less, live in that terrible
intimacy of patient and nurse?  Oh, the miserable
shame of it!  All her womanhood shivered.  Yet
she must go through the ordeal.  His bandaged
eyes promised a short time of probation.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, after a restless night, she pulled
herself together.  After all, what need for such a
commotion?  If the three and a half years of war
had not taught her dignity and self-reliance, she had
learned but little.
</p>

<p>
There were four beds in the ward.  Two on the
right were occupied by officers, one with an
arm-wound, another with a hole through his body.
The third on the left by a pathetic-looking boy with
a shattered knee, which, as the night Sister told her,
gave him unceasing pain.  The fourth by Major
Shileto.  To him she went first and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"I'm the day Sister.  What kind of a night have
you had?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!"  His lips curled in a pleasant smile.
"Just one long, beautiful blank."
</p>

<p>
"And the head?"
</p>

<p>
"Jammy.  That's what it feels like.  How it looks,
I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"We'll see later when I do the dressings."
</p>

<p>
She went off to the boy.  He also was a Canadian
officer, and his name was Robin McKay.  She
lingered awhile in talk.
</p>

<p>
"Strikes me my military career is over, and I'll
just have to hump round real estate in Winnipeg on
a wooden leg."
</p>

<p>
"They aren't going to cut your leg off, you silly
boy!" she laughed.  "And what do you mean by
'humping round real estate?'"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a land surveyor.  That's to say, my father
is.  See here: When are they going to send me back?
I'm afraid of this country."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It's so lonesome.  I don't know a soul."
</p>

<p>
"We'll fix that up all right for you," she said
cheerily.  "Don't worry."
</p>

<p>
The morning routine of the hospital began.  In
its appointed course came the time for dressings.
Camilla, her nerves under control, went to Shileto.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to worry you, but I'll try to hurt as little
as I can."
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead.  Never mind me."
</p>

<p>
A probationer stood by, serving the laden
wheel-table.  At first, the symmetrically bandaged head
seemed that of a thousand cases with which she had
dealt.  But when the crisp brown hair came to view,
her hand trembled ever so little.  She avoided
touching it as far as was possible, for she remembered
its feel.  Dead, forgotten words rose lambent in her
memory: "<i>It crackles like a cat's back.  Let me see if
there are sparks</i>."
</p>

<p>
But in the midst of a great shaven patch there was
a horrible scalp-wound which claimed her deftest
skill.  And she worked with steady fingers and
uncovered the maimed brows and eyelids and
cheekbones.  How the sight had been preserved was a
miracle.  She cleansed the wounds with antiseptics
and freed the eyelashes.  She bent over him with
deliberate intent.
</p>

<p>
"You can open your eyes for a second or two.
You can see all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather.  I can see your belt."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, then."
</p>

<p>
With her swift craft, she blindfolded him anew,
completed the bandaging, laid him back on his pillow,
and went off with the probationer, wheeling the
table to the other cases.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day, she was doing him some trivial
service.
</p>

<p>
"What's the good of lying in bed all day?" he
asked.  "I want to get up and walk about."
</p>

<p>
"You've got a bit of a temperature."
</p>

<p>
"How much?"
</p>

<p>
"Ninety-nine point eight."
</p>

<p>
"Call that a temperature?  I've gone about with
a hundred and three."
</p>

<p>
"When was that?"
</p>

<p>
"When I first went out to Canada.  I'm English,
you know&mdash;only left the Old Country in Nineteen
thirteen.  But, when the war broke out, I joined up
with the first batch of Canadians&mdash;lucky to start
with a commission.  Lord, it was hell's delight!"
</p>

<p>
"So I've been given to understand," said Camilla.
"But what about your temperature of a hundred
and three?"
</p>

<p>
"I was a young fool," said he, "and I didn't
care what happened to me."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
For a while he did not answer.  He bit his lower
lip, showing just a fine line of white teeth.  Memory
again clutched her.  She was also struck by his
unconscious realization of the aging quality of the war
in that he spoke of his Nineteen-thirteen self as "a
young fool."  So far as that went, they thought in
common.
</p>

<p>
Presently he said,
</p>

<p>
"Your voice reminds me of some one I used to know."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, here, in London."
</p>

<p>
She lied instinctively, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"It couldn't have been me.  I've only just come
to London&mdash;and I've never met Major Shileto
before in my life."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," he asserted readily.  "But I
had no idea two human voices could be so nearly
identical."
</p>

<p>
"Still," she remarked, "you haven't told me of the
temperature of a hundred and three."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is no story.  Your voice brought it all
back.  You've heard of a man's own angry pride
being cap and bells for a fool?  Well"&mdash;he laughed
apologetically&mdash;"it's idiotic.  There's no point in
it.  I just went about for a week in a Canadian
winter with that temperature&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Because you couldn't bear to lie alone and think?"
</p>

<p>
"That's about it."
</p>

<p>
"Sister!" cried the boy, Robin McKay, from the
next bed.
</p>

<p>
She obeyed the summons.  What was the matter?
</p>

<p>
"Everything seems to have got mixed up, and
my knee's hurting like fury."
</p>

<p>
She attended to his crumpled bedclothes, cracked
a little joke which made him laugh.  Then the
two other men claimed her notice.  She carried on
her work outwardly calm, smiling, self-reliant, the
perfectly trained woman of the war.  But her
heart was beating in an unaccustomed way.
</p>

<p>
Her ministrations over, she left the ward for duty
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
At tea-time she returned, and aided the blindfolded
man to get through the meal.  The dread of
the morning had given place to mingled mind-racking
wonder and timidity.  He had gone off, on the
hot speed of their last quarrel, out of her life.  Save
for a short, anguished period, during which she had
lost self-control, she had never reproached him.
She had asserted her freedom.  He had asserted
his.  Nay; more&mdash;he had held the door open for a
way out from an impossible situation, and she had
slammed the door in his face.  Self-centered in those
days, centered since the beginning of the war in
human suffering, she had thought little of the man's
feelings.  He had gone away and forgotten, or done
his best to forget, an ugly memory.  Her last night's
review of ghosts had proved the non-existence of
any illusions among them.  But now, now that the
chances of war had brought them again together,
the sound of her voice had conjured up in him, too,
the ghosts of the past.  She had been responsible
for his going-about with a temperature of a hundred
and three, and for his not caring what happened to
him.  He had lifted the corner of a curtain,
revealing the possibility of undreamed-of happenings.
</p>

<p>
"You were quoting Tennyson just now," she remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Was I?"
</p>

<p>
"Your cap-and-bells speech."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  What about it?"
</p>

<p>
"I was only wondering."
</p>

<p>
"Like a woman, you resent a half-confidence."
</p>

<p>
She drew in a sharp little breath.  The words, the
tone, stabbed her.  She might have been talking to
him in one of their pleasanter hours in the Chelsea
flat.  In spite of her burning curiosity, she said,
"I'm not a woman; I'm a nurse."
</p>

<p>
"Since when?"
</p>

<p>
"As far as you people are concerned, since
September, '14, when I went out to France.  I've been
through everything&mdash;from the firing-line
field-ambulances, casualty clearing-stations, base
hospitals&mdash;and now I'm here having a rest-cure.
Hundreds and hundreds of men have told me their
troubles&mdash;so I've got to regard myself as a sort of
mother confessor."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Then, like a mother confessor, you resent a
half-confidence?"
</p>

<p>
She put a cigarette between his lips and lit it for
him.
</p>

<p>
"It all depends," she said lightly, "whether you
want absolution or not.  I suppose it's the same old
story."  She held her voice in command.  "Every
man thinks it's original.  What kind of a woman
was she?"
</p>

<p>
He parried the thrust.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that rather too direct a question, even for
a mother confessor?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll be spilling ash all over the bed.  Here's
an ash-tray."  She guided his hand.  "Then you
don't want absolution?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I do!  But, you see, I'm not yet <i>in
articulo mortis</i>, so I'll put off my confession."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, you loved the woman you treated
badly?"  The question was as casual as she could
make it, while she settled the tea-things on the tray.
</p>

<p>
"It was a girl, not a woman."
</p>

<p>
"What has become of her?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I should like to know."
</p>

<p>
"But you loved her?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I did!  I'm not a blackguard.  Of
course I loved her."  Her pulses quickened.  "But
much water has run under London Bridge since then."
</p>

<p>
"And much blood has flowed in France."
</p>

<p>
"Everything&mdash;lives, habits, modes of thought
have been revolutionized.  Yes"&mdash;he reflected for
a moment&mdash;"it's odd how you have brought back
old days.  I fell in with a pestilential, so-called
artistic crowd&mdash;I am an architect by profession&mdash;you
know, men with long greasy hair and dirty
finger nails and anarchical views.  There was one
chap especially, who I thought was decadent to the
bone.  Aloysius Eglington, he called himself."  The
man sprang vivid to her memory; he had once tried
to make love to her.  "Well, I came across him the
other day with a couple of wound-stripes and the
military-cross ribbon.  For a man like that, what
an upheaval!"  He laughed again.  "I suppose
I've been a bit upheaved myself."
</p>

<p>
"I'm beginning to piece together your story of the
temperature," she said pleasantly.  "I suppose the
girl was one of the young females of this anarchical
crowd?"
</p>

<p>
Obviously the phrase jarred.
</p>

<p>
"I could never regard her in that light," he said
coldly.
</p>

<p>
"The war has got hold of her, too, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt.  She was a medical student.  May
I have another cigarette?"
</p>

<p>
His tone signified the end of the topic.  She smiled,
for her putting-down was a triumph.
</p>

<p>
The probationer came up and took away the tea-tray.
Camilla left her patient and went to the other beds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
That night again, she sat alone in her little white
room and thought and thought.  She had started
the day with half-formed plans of flight before her
identity could be discovered.  She was there
voluntarily, purely as an act of grace.  She could walk
out, without reproach, at a moment's notice.  But
now&mdash;had not the situation changed?  To her,
as to a stranger, he had confessed his love.  She
had not dared probe deeper&mdash;but might not a
deeper probing have brought to light something
abiding and beautiful?  In the war, she had
accomplished her womanhood.  Proudly and rightly
she recognized her development.  He, too, had
accomplished his manhood.  And his dear face would
be maimed and scarred for the rest of his life.  Then,
with the suddenness of a tropical storm, a wave of
intolerable emotion surged through her.  She uttered
a little cry and broke into a passion of tears.  And
so her love was reborn.
</p>

<p>
Professional to the tips of her cool fingers, she
dressed his wounds the next morning.  But she did
not lure him back across the years.  The present
held its own happiness, tremulous in its delicacy.
It was he who questioned.  Whereabouts in France
had she been?  She replied with scraps of anecdote.
There was little of war's horror and peril through
which she had not passed.  She explained her
present position in the hospital.
</p>

<p>
"By George, you're splendid!" he cried.  "I
wish I could have a look at you."
</p>

<p>
"You've lost your chance for to-day," she
answered gaily.  For she had completed the bandaging.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, she went out and walked the streets
in a day-dream, a soft light in her eyes.  The
moment of recognition&mdash;and it was bound soon to
come&mdash;could not fail in its touch of sanctification,
its touch of beauty.  He and she had passed through
fires of hell and had emerged purified and tempered.
They were clear-eyed, clear-souled.  The greatest
gift of God, miraculously regiven, they could not
again despise.  On that dreary afternoon, Oxford
Street hummed with joy.
</p>

<p>
Only a freak of chance had hitherto preserved
her anonymity.  A reference by matron or
probationer to Sister Warrington would betray her
instantly.  Should she await or anticipate betrayal?
</p>

<p>
In a fluttering tumult of indecision, she returned
to the hospital.  The visiting-hour had begun.
When she had taken off her outdoor things, she
looked into the ward.  Around the two beds on the
right, little groups of friends were stationed.  The
boy, Robin McKay, in the bed nearest the door on
the left, caught sight of her and summoned her.
</p>

<p>
"Sister, come and pretend to be a visitor.  There's
not a soul in this country who could possibly come
to see me.  You don't know what it is to be homesick."
</p>

<p>
She sat by his side.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Imagine I'm an elderly maiden aunt
from the country."
</p>

<p>
"You?" he cried, with overseas frankness.
"You're only a kid yourself."
</p>

<p>
Major Shileto overheard and laughed.  She
blushed and half rose.
</p>

<p>
"That's not the way to treat visitors, Mr. McKay."
</p>

<p>
The boy stretched out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully sorry if I was rude.  Don't go."
</p>

<p>
She yielded.
</p>

<p>
"All the same," she said, "you'll have to get used
to a bit of loneliness.  It can't be helped.  Besides,
you're not the only tiger that hasn't got a Christian.
There's Major Shileto.  And you can read and he can't."
</p>

<p>
The voice came from the next bed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about me.  Talk to the boy.  I'll
have some one to see me to-morrow.  He won't,
poor old chap!"
</p>

<p>
"Have a game of chess?" said the boy.
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure."
</p>

<p>
She fetched the board and chessmen from the
long table running down the center of the ward,
and they set out the pieces.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon to be rather good," said he.  "Perhaps
I might give you something."
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather good myself," she replied.  "I was
taught by&mdash;"  She stopped short, on the brink of
pronouncing the name of the young Polish master
who lived (in a very material sense) on the fringe of
the Chelsea crew.  "We'll start even, at any rate."
</p>

<p>
They began.  She realized that the boy had not
boasted, and soon she became absorbed in the game.
So intent was she on the problem presented by a
brilliant and unexpected move on his part that she
did not notice the opening of the door and the swift
passage of a fur-coated figure behind her chair.  It
was a cry that startled her.  A cry of surprise and
joy, a cry of the heart.
</p>

<p>
"Marjorie!"
</p>

<p>
She looked up and saw the fur-coated figure&mdash;that
of a girl with fair hair&mdash;on her knees by the
bedside, and Harry Shileto's arms were round her
and his lips to hers.  She stared, frozen.  She heard:
</p>

<p>
"I didn't expect you till to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I just had time to catch the train at Inverness.
I've not brought an ounce of luggage.  Oh, my poor,
poor, old Harry!"
</p>

<p>
It was horrible.
</p>

<p>
The boy said:
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Sister; he's got his Christian all
right.  Let's get on with the game."
</p>

<p>
Mechanically obeying a professional instinct, she
looked at the swimming chess-board and made a
move haphazard.
</p>

<p>
"I say&mdash;that won't do!" cried the boy.  "It's
mate for me in two moves.  Buck up!"
</p>

<p>
With a great effort, she caught the vanishing
tail of her previous calculation and made a move
which happened to be correct.
</p>

<p>
"That's better," he said.  "I hoped you wouldn't
spot it.  But I couldn't let you play the ass with
your knight and spoil the game.  Now, this
demands deep consideration."
</p>

<p>
He lingered a while over his move.  She looked
across.  The pair at the next bed were talking in
whispers.  The girl was now sitting on the chair by
the bedside, and her back hid the face of the man,
though her head was near his.
</p>

<p>
"There!" cried the boy triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon; I didn't see it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!"  His finger indicated the move.
</p>

<p>
With half her brain at work, she moved a pawn
a cautious step.  The boy's whole heart was in his
offensive.  He swooped a bishop triumphantly
athwart the board.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing can save you for mate in
five moves.  I know it isn't the proper thing to be
chatting over chess, but I like it.  I'm chatty by
nature."
</p>

<p>
"Only one course open to save me from destruction?"
she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Just one."
</p>

<p>
And she heard, from the next bed:
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure, darling, you're only saying it to
break the shock gently?  Are you sure your eyes
are all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly certain."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could have real proof."
</p>

<p>
Camilla stared at the blankness of her vanished
dream.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Sister; put your back into it,"
chuckled Robin McKay.
</p>

<p>
She held her brows tight with her hands and strove
to concentrate her tortured mind on the board.
Her heart was in agony of desolation.  The soft
murmurings she could not but overhear pierced her
brain.  The poignant shame of her disillusionment
burned her from head to foot.  Again she heard
the girl's pleading voice:
</p>

<p>
"Only for a minute.  It couldn't hurt."
</p>

<p>
The boy said:
</p>

<p>
"Buck up.  Just one tiny brain-wave."
</p>

<p>
At the end of her tether, she cried: "The only
way out!  I give it up!" and swept the pieces over
the board.
</p>

<p>
She rose, stood transfixed with horror and sense
of outrage.  Harry Shileto, propped on pillows,
was unwinding the bandages from his mangled head.
Devils within her clamored for hysterical outcry.
But something physical happened and checked the
breath that was about to utter his Christian name.
The boy had gripped her arm with all his young
strength in passionate remonstrance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear old thing&mdash;do play the game!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said, and he released her.
</p>

<p>
So she passed swiftly round the boy's bed to that
of the foolish patient and arrested his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Major Shileto, what on earth are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
The girl, who was very pretty, turned on her an
alarmed and tearful face.
</p>

<p>
"It was my fault, Sister.  Oh, can I believe him?"
</p>

<p>
"You can believe me, at any rate," she replied
with asperity, swiftly readjusting the bandage.
"Major Shileto's sight is unaffected.  But if I had
not been here and he had succeeded in taking off
his dressings, God knows what would have happened.
Major Shileto, I put you on your honor not to do
such a silly thing again."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Sister," he said, with a little
shame-faced twitch of the lips.  "<i>Parole d'officier</i>."
</p>

<p>
The girl rose and drew her a step aside.
</p>

<p>
"Do forgive me, Sister.  We have only been
married five months&mdash;when he was last home on
leave&mdash;and, you understand, don't you, what it
would have meant to me if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do.  Anyhow, you can be perfectly
reassured.  But I must warn you," she whispered,
and looked through narrowed eyelids into the girl's
eyes; "he may be dreadfully disfigured."
</p>

<p>
The girl shrank terrified, but she cried,
</p>

<p>
"I hope I shall love him all the more for it!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, too," replied Camilla soberly.  "I'll
say good-by," she added, in a louder tone, holding
out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you again to-morrow?" the girl asked
politely.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" cried Shileto.
</p>

<p>
"I told you I was only here as a bird of passage.
My time's up to-day.  Good-by."
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully sorry.  Good-by."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands.  Camilla went to Robin
McKay and bent over him.
</p>

<p>
"You're quite right, my dear boy.  One ought
to play the game to the bitter end.  It's the thing
most worth doing in life.  God bless you!"
</p>

<p>
The boy stared wonderingly at her as she disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad she's not going to be here any more,"
said the girl.
</p>

<p>
Her husband's lips smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"She's a most heartless, overbearing woman."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they all seem like that when they're upset,"
he laughed.  "And I was really playing the most
outrageous fool."
</p>

<p>
She put her head close to him and whispered,
</p>

<p>
"Don't you guess why I was so madly anxious to
know that you could see?"
</p>

<p>
She told him.  And, from that moment, the
possessor of the remembered voice faded from his
memory.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Camilla went to the matron.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, but I've bitten off more than I can
chew.  If I go on an hour longer, I'll break down.
I'm due in France in a fortnight, and I must have
my rest."
</p>

<p>
"I can only thank you for your self-sacrificing
help," said the matron.
</p>

<p>
But, four days later, ten days before her leave had
expired, Camilla appeared at the casualty clearing-station
in France of which she was a Sister-in-charge.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil are you here for?" asked the
amazed commanding medical officer.
</p>

<p>
"England's too full of ghosts.  They scared me
back to realities."
</p>

<p>
The M.O. laughed to hide his inability to understand.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you like 'em, it's all the same to me.
I'm delighted to have you.  But give me the good
old ghosts of blighty all the time!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The piercing of the line at Cambrai was a surprise
no less to the Germans than to the British.  The
great tent of the casualty clearing-station was
crammed with wounded.  Doctors and nurses, with
tense, burning eyes and bodies aching from strain,
worked and worked, and thought nothing of that
which might be passing outside.  No one knew that
the German wave had passed over.  And the
German wave itself, at that part of the line, was but
a set of straggling and mystified groups.
</p>

<p>
Camilla Warrington, head of the heroic host of
women working in the dimly lit reek of blood and
agony, had not slept for two nights and two days.
The last convoy of wounded had poured in a couple
of hours before.  She stood by the surgeon, aiding
him, the perfect machine.  At last, in the terrible
rota, they came to a man swathed round the middle
in the rough bandages of the field dressing-station.
He was unconscious.  They unwound him, and
revealed a sight of unimaginable horror.
</p>

<p>
"He's no good, poor chap!" said the surgeon.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you try?" she asked, and put repressing
hands on the wounded man.
</p>

<p>
"Not the slightest good," said the medical officer.
</p>

<p>
No one in the great tent of agony knew that they
were isolated from the British army.  From the
outside, it looked solitary, lighted, and secure.
Two German soldiers, casual stragglers, looked in at
the door of the great tent.  In the kindly German
way, they each threw in a bomb, and ran off
laughing.  Seven men were killed outright and many
rewounded.  And Camilla Warrington was killed.[<a id="chap0304fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn1">1</a>]

<h3>
THE PRINCESS'S KINGDOM
</h3>

<p>
That there was once a real Prince Rabomirski
is beyond question.  That he was Ottilie's
father may be taken for granted.  But that
the Princess Rabomirski had a right to bear the title
many folks were scandalously prepared to deny.  It
is true that when the news of the Prince's death
reached Monte Carlo, the Princess, who was there at
the time, showed various persons on whose indiscretion
she could rely a holograph letter of condolence
from the Tsar, and later unfolded to the amiable
muddle-headed the intricacies of a lawsuit which
she was instituting for the recovery of the estates in
Poland; but her detractors roundly declared the
holograph letter to be a forgery and the lawsuit a
fiction of her crafty brain.  Princess however she
continued to style herself in Cosmopolis, and
Princess she was styled by all and sundry.  And
little Ottilie Rabomirski was called the Princess
Ottilie.
</p>

<p>
Among the people who joined heart and soul with
the detractors was young Vince Somerset.  If there
was one person whom he despised and hated more
than Count Bernheim (of the Holy Roman Empire)
it was the Princess Rabomirski.  In his eyes she was
everything that a princess, a lady, a woman, and a
mother should not be.  She dressed ten years younger
than was seemly, she spoke English like a barmaid
and French like a cocotte, she gambled her way
through Europe from year's end to year's end, and
after neglecting Ottilie for twenty years, she was
about to marry her to Bernheim.  The last was the
unforgivable offence.
</p>

<p>
The young man walked up and down the Casino
Terrace of Illerville-sur-Mer, and poured into a
friend's ear his flaming indignation.  He was nine
and twenty, and though he pursued the unpoetical
avocation of sub-editing the foreign telegrams on a
London daily newspaper, retained some of the
vehemence of undergraduate days when he had
chosen the career (now abandoned) of poet, artist,
dramatist, and irreconcilable politician.
</p>

<p>
"Look at them!" he cried, indicating a couple
seated at a distant table beneath the awning of the
café.  "Did you ever see anything so horrible in
your life?  The maiden and the Minotaur.  When
I heard of the engagement to-day I wouldn't
believe it until she herself told me.  She doesn't
know the man's abomination.  He's a by-word of
reproach through Europe.  His name stinks like
his infernal body.  The live air reeks with the scent
he pours upon himself.  There can be no turpitude
under the sun in which the wretch doesn't wallow.
Do you know that he killed his first wife?  Oh, I
don't mean that he cut her throat.  That's far too
primitive for such a complex hound.  There are
other ways of murdering a woman, my dear Ross.
You kick her body and break her heart and defile
her soul.  That's what he did.  And he has done
it to other women."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear man," remarked Ross, elderly and
cynical, "he is colossally rich."
</p>

<p>
"Rich!  Do you know where he made his money?
In the cesspool of European finance.  He's a Jew by
race, a German by parentage, an Italian by
upbringing and a Greek by profession.  He has
bucket-shops and low-down money-lenders' cribs and rotten
companies all over the Continent.  Do you remember
Sequasto and Co.?  That was Bernheim.  England's
too hot to hold him.  Look at him now he has
taken off his hat.  Do you know why he wears his
greasy hair plastered over half his damned forehead?
It's to hide the mark of the Beast.  He's Antichrist!
And when I think of that Jezebel from the Mile End
Road putting Ottilie into his arms, it makes me see
red.  By heavens, it's touch and go that I don't slay
the pair of them."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely they're not as bad as they're painted,"
said his friend.
</p>

<p>
"She couldn't be," Somerset retorted grimly.
</p>

<p>
Ross laughed, looked at his watch, and announced
that it was time for <i>apéritifs</i>.  The young man
assented moodily, and they crossed the Terrace to the
café tables beneath the awning.  It was the dying
afternoon of a sultry August day, and most of Illerville
had deserted tennis courts, <i>tir aux pigeons</i> and
other distractions to listen lazily to the band in the
Casino shade.  The place was crowded; not a table
vacant.  When the waiter at last brought one from
the interior of the café, he dumped it down beside
the table occupied by the unspeakable Bernheim and
the little Princess Ottilie.  Somerset raised his hat
as he took his seat.  Bernheim responded with
elaborate politeness, and Princess Ottilie greeted him
with a faint smile.  The engaged pair spoke very
little to each other.  Bernheim lounged back in his
chair smoking a cigar and looked out to sea with a
bored expression.  When the girl made a casual
remark he nodded rudely without turning his head.
Somerset felt an irresistible desire to kick him.  His
external appearance was of the type that irritated
the young Englishman.  He was too handsome in
a hard, swaggering black-mustachioed way; he
exaggerated to offence the English style of easy dress;
he wore a too devil-may-care Panama, a too
obtrusive coloured shirt and club tie; he wore no
waistcoat, and the hem of his new flannel trousers,
turned up six inches, disclosed a stretch of
tan-coloured silk socks clocked with gold matching
elegant tan shoes.  He went about with a broken-spirited
poodle.  He was inordinately scented.  Somerset
glowered at him, and let his drink remain untasted.
</p>

<p>
Presently Bernheim summoned the waiter, paid
him for the tea the girl had been drinking and
pushed back his chair.
</p>

<p>
"This hole is getting on my nerves," he said in
French to his companion.  "I am going into the
<i>cercle</i> to play écarté.  Will you go to your mother
whom I see over there, or will you stay here?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll stay here," said the little Princess Ottilie.
</p>

<p>
Bernheim nodded and swaggered off.  Somerset
bent forward.
</p>

<p>
"I must see you alone to-night&mdash;quite alone.
I must have you all to myself.  How can you
manage it?"
</p>

<p>
Ottilie looked at him anxiously.  She was fair and
innocent, of a prettiness more English than foreign,
and the scare in her blue eyes made them all the
more appealing to the young man.
</p>

<p>
"What is the good?  You can't help me.  Don't
you see that it is all arranged?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll undertake to disarrange it at a moment's
notice," said Somerset.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she whispered, glancing round; "somebody
will hear.  Everything is gossiped about in
this place."
</p>

<p>
"Well, will you meet me?" the young man persisted.
</p>

<p>
"If I can," she sighed.  "If they are both playing
baccarat I may slip out for a little."
</p>

<p>
"As at Spa."
</p>

<p>
She smiled and a slight flush came into her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as at Spa.  Wait for me on the <i>plage</i> at the
bottom of the Casino steps.  Now I must go to my
mother.  She would not like to see me talking to you."
</p>

<p>
"The Princess hates me like poison.  Do you know why?"
</p>

<p>
"No, and you are not going to tell me," she said
demurely.  "<i>Au revoir</i>."
</p>

<p>
When she had passed out of earshot, Ross touched
the young man's arm.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, my dear Somerset, you are playing a
particularly silly fool's game."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never played it?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!"
</p>

<p>
"It would be a precious sight better for you if you
had," growled Somerset.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take another quinquina," said Ross.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see the way in which the brute treated
her?" Somerset exclaimed angrily.  "If it's like that
before marriage, what will it be after?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of money, separate establishments, perfect
independence and happiness for each."
</p>

<p>
Somerset rose from the table.
</p>

<p>
"There are times, my good Ross," said he, "when
I absolutely hate you."
</p>

<p>
Somerset had first met the Princess Rabomirski
and her daughter three years before, at Spa.  They
were staying at the same hotel, a very modest one
which, to Somerset's mind, ill-accorded with the
Princess's pretensions.  Bernheim was also in
attendance, but he disposed his valet, his motor-car,
and himself in the luxurious Hôtel d'Orange, as
befitted a man of his quality; also he was in
attendance not on Ottilie, but on the Princess, who
at that time was three years younger and a trifle less
painted.  Now, at Illerville-sur-Mer the trio were
stopping at the Hotel Splendide, a sumptuous
hostelry where season prices were far above
Somerset's moderate means.  He contented himself
with the little hotel next door, and hated the Hotel
Splendide and all that it contained, save Ottilie,
with all his heart.  But at Spa, the Princess was
evidently in low water from which she did not seem to
be rescued by her varying luck at the tables.
Ottilie was then a child of seventeen, and Somerset
was less attracted by her delicate beauty than by
her extraordinary loneliness.  Day after day, night
after night he would come upon her sitting solitary
on one of the settees in the gaming-rooms, like a
forgotten fan or flower, or wandering wistfully from
table to table, idly watching the revolving wheels.
Sometimes she would pause behind her mother's
or Bernheim's chair to watch their game; but the
Princess called her a little <i>porte-malheur</i> and would
drive her away.  In the mornings, or on other rare
occasions, when the elder inseparables were not playing
roulette, Ottilie hovered round them at a distance,
as disregarded as a shadow that followed them in
space of less dimensions, as it were, wherever they
went.  In the Casino rooms, if men spoke to her,
she replied in shy monosyllables and shrank away.
Somerset who had made regular acquaintance with
the Princess at the hotel and taken a chivalrous pity
on the girl's loneliness, she admitted first to a timid
friendship, and then to a childlike intimacy.  Her
face would brighten and her heart beat a little
faster when she saw his young, well-knit figure
appear in the distance; for she knew he would come
straight to her and take her from the hot room,
heavy with perfumes and tobacco, on to the cool
balcony, and talk of all manner of pleasant things.
And Somerset found in this neglected, little sham
Princess what his youth was pleased to designate a
flower-like soul.  Those were idyllic hours.  The
Princess, glad to get the embarrassing child out of
the way, took no notice of the intimacy.  Somerset
fell in love.
</p>

<p>
It lasted out a three-years' separation, during
which he did not hear from her.  He had written to
several addresses, but a cold Post Office returned his
letters undelivered, and his only consolation was to
piece together from various sources the unedifying
histories of the Princess Rabomirski and the Count
Bernheim of the Holy Roman Empire.  He came
to Illerville-sur-Mer for an August holiday.  The
first thing he did when shown into his hotel bedroom
was to gaze out of window at the beach and the sea.
The first person his eyes rested upon was the little
Princess Ottilie issuing, alone as usual, from the
doors of the next hotel.
</p>

<p>
He had been at Illerville a fortnight&mdash;a fortnight
of painful joy.  Things had changed.  Their
interviews had been mostly stolen, for the Princess
Rabomirski had rudely declined to renew the
acquaintance and had forbidden Ottilie to speak to
him.  The girl, though apparently as much neglected
as ever, was guarded against him with peculiar
ingenuity.  Somerset, aware that Ottilie, now grown
from a child into an exquisitely beautiful and
marriageable young woman, was destined by a hardened
sinner like the Princess for a wealthier husband than
a poor newspaper man with no particular prospects,
could not, however, quite understand the reasons
for the virulent hatred of which he was the object.
He overheard the Princess one day cursing her
daughter in execrable German for having acknowledged
his bow a short time before.  Their only
undisturbed time together was in the sea during the
bathing hour.  The Princess, hating the pebbly
beach which cut to pieces her high-heeled shoes,
never watched the bathers; and Bernheim did not
bathe (Somerset, prejudiced, declared that he did
not even wash) but remained in his bedroom till the
hour of <i>déjeuner</i>.  Ottilie, attended only by her
maid, came down to the water's edge, threw off her
<i>peignoir</i>, and, plunging into the water, found
Somerset waiting.
</p>

<p>
Now Somerset was a strong swimmer.  Moderately
proficient at all games as a boy and an undergraduate,
he had found that swimming was the only
sport in which he excelled, and he had cultivated
and maintained the art.  Oddly enough, the little
Princess Ottilie, in spite of her apparent fragility,
was also an excellent and fearless swimmer.  She
had another queer delight for a creature so daintily
feminine, the <i>salle d'armes</i>, so that the muscles of
her young limbs were firm and well ordered.  But
the sea was her passion.  If an additional bond
between Somerset and herself were needed it would
have been this.  Yet, though it is a pleasant thing
to swim far away into the loneliness of the sea with
the object of one's affections, the conditions do not
encourage sustained conversation on subjects of
vital interest.  On the day when Somerset learned
that his little princess was engaged to Bernheim
he burned to tell her more than could be spluttered
out in ten fathoms of water.  So he urged her to an
assignation.
</p>

<p>
At half-past ten she joined him at the bottom of
the Casino steps.  The shingly beach was deserted,
but on the terrace above the throng was great, owing
to the breathless heat of the night.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven you have come," said he.  "Do
you know how I have longed for you?"
</p>

<p>
She glanced up wistfully into his face.  In her
simple cream dress and burnt straw hat adorned with
white roses around the brim, she looked very fair and
childlike.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say such things," she whispered.
"They are wrong now.  I am engaged to be married."
</p>

<p>
"I won't hear of it," said Somerset.  "It is a
horrible nightmare&mdash;your engagement.  Don't you
know that I love you?  I loved you the first minute
I set my eyes on you at Spa."
</p>

<p>
Princess Ottilie sighed, and they walked along the
boards behind the bathing-machines, and down the
rattling beach to the shelter of a fishing boat, where
they sat down, screened from the world with the
murmuring sea in front of them.  Somerset talked of
his love and the hatefulness of Bernheim.  The little
Princess sighed again.
</p>

<p>
"I have worse news still," she said.  "It will pain
you.  We are going to Paris to-morrow, and then on
to Aix-les-Bains.  They have just decided.  They
say the baccarat here is silly, and they might as well
play for bon-bons.  So we must say good-bye
to-night&mdash;and it will be good-bye for always."
</p>

<p>
"I will come to Aix-les-Bains," said Somerset.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no," she answered quickly.  "It would
only bring trouble on me and do no good.  We must
part to-night.  Don't you think it hurts me?"
</p>

<p>
"But you must love me," said Somerset.
</p>

<p>
"I do," she said simply, "and that is why it hurts.
Now I must be going back."
</p>

<p>
"Ottilie," said Somerset, grasping her hands:
"Need you ever go back?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Come away from this hateful place with me&mdash;now,
this minute.  You need never see Bernheim
again as long as you live.  Listen.  My friend
Ross has a motor-car.  I can manage it&mdash;so there
will be only us two.  Run into your hotel for a thick
cloak, and meet me as quickly as you can behind the
tennis-courts.  If we go full speed we'll catch the
night-boat at Dieppe.  It will be a wild race for
our life happiness.  Come."
</p>

<p>
In his excitement he rose and pulled her to her feet.
They faced each other for a few glorious moments,
panting for breath, and then Princess Ottilie broke
down and cried bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"I can't dear, I can't.  I must marry Bernheim.
It is to save my mother from something dreadful.
I don't know what it is&mdash;but she went on her knees
to me, and I promised."
</p>

<p>
"If there's a woman in Europe capable of getting
out of her difficulties unaided it is the Princess
Rabomirski," said Somerset.  "I am not going to let you
be sold.  You are mine, Ottilie, and by Heaven, I'm
going to have you.  Come."
</p>

<p>
He urged, he pleaded, he put his strong arms
around her as if he would carry her away bodily.
He did everything that a frantic young man could
do.  But the more the little Princess wept, the more
inflexible she became.  Somerset had not realized
before this steel in her nature.  Raging and
vehemently urging he accompanied her back to the
Casino steps.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to say good-bye to me to-morrow
morning, instead of to-night?" she asked, holding
out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I am never going to say good-bye," cried
Somerset.
</p>

<p>
"I shall slip out to-morrow morning for a last
swim&mdash;at six o'clock," she said, unheeding his
exclamation.  "Our train goes at ten."  Then she
came very close to him.
</p>

<p>
"Vince dear, if you love me, don't make me more
unhappy than I am."
</p>

<p>
It was an appeal to his chivalry.  He kissed her
hand, and said:
</p>

<p>
"At six o'clock."
</p>

<p>
But Somerset had no intention of bidding her a
final farewell in the morning.  If he followed her the
world over he would snatch her out of the arms of the
accursed Bernheim and marry her by main force.
As for the foreign telegrams of <i>The Daily Post</i>, he
cared not how they would be sub-edited.  He went
to bed with lofty disregard of Fleet Street and bread
and butter.  As for the shame from which Ottilie's
marriage would save her sainted mother, he did not
believe a word of it.  She was selling Ottilie to
Bernheim for cash down.  He stayed awake most
of the night plotting schemes for the rescue of his
Princess.  It would be an excellent plan to insult
Bernheim and slay him outright in a duel.  Its
disadvantages lay in his own imperfections as a
duellist, and for the first time he cursed the benign
laws of his country.  At length he fell asleep; woke
up to find it daylight, and leaped to his feet in a
horrible scare.  But a sight of his watch reassured
him.  It was only five o'clock.  At half-past he
put on a set of bathing things and sat down by the
window to watch the hall door of the Hotel Splendide.
At six, out came the familiar figure of the little
Princess, draped in her white <i>peignoir</i>.  She glanced
up at Somerset's window.  He waved his hand, and
in a minute or two they were standing side by side
at the water's edge.  It was far away from the
regular bathing-place marked by the bathing cabins,
and further still from the fishing end of the beach
where alone at that early hour were signs of life
visible.  The town behind them slept in warmth
and light.  The sea stretched out blue before them
unrippled in the still air.  A little bank of purple
cloud on the horizon presaged a burning day.
</p>

<p>
The little Princess dropped her <i>peignoir</i> and kicked
off her straw-soled shoes, and gave her hand to her
companion.  He glanced at the little white feet
which he was tempted to fall down and kiss, and then
at the wistful face below the blue-silk foulard knotted
in front over the bathing-cap.  His heart leaped at
her bewildering sweetness.  She was the morning
incarnate.
</p>

<p>
She read his eyes and flushed pink.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go in," she said.
</p>

<p>
They waded in together, hand-in-hand, until
they were waist deep.  Then they struck out,
making for the open sea.  The sting of the night had
already passed from the water.  To their young
blood it felt warm.  They swam near together,
Ottilie using a steady breast stroke and Somerset a
side stroke, so that he could look at her flushed and
glistening face.  From the blue of the sea and the
blue of the sky to the light blue of the silk foulard,
the blue of her eyes grew magically deep.
</p>

<p>
"There seems to be nothing but you and me in
God's universe, Ottilie," said he.  She smiled at
him.  He drew quite close to her.
</p>

<p>
"If we could only go on straight until we found
an enchanted island which we could have as our
kingdom."
</p>

<p>
"The sea must be our kingdom," said Ottilie.
</p>

<p>
"Or its depths.  Shall we dive down and look for
the 'ceiling of amber, the pavement of pearl,' and the
'red gold throne in the heart of the sea' for the two
of us?"
</p>

<p>
"We should be happier than in the world," replied
the little Princess.
</p>

<p>
They swam on slowly, dreamily, in silence.  The
mild waves lapped against their ears and their
mouths.  The morning sun lay at their backs, and
its radiance fell athwart the bay.  Through the
stillness came the faint echo of a fisherman on the
far beach hammering at his boat.  Beyond that and
the gentle swirl of the water there was no sound.
After a while they altered their course so as to reach
a small boat that lay at anchor for the convenience
of the stronger swimmers.  They clambered
up and sat on the gunwale, their feet dangling in
the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Is my princess tired?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She laughed in merry scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Tired?  Why, I could swim twenty times as far.
Do you think I have no muscle?  Feel.  Don't you
know I fence all the winter?"
</p>

<p>
She braced her bare arm.  He felt the muscle;
then, relaxing it, by drawing down her wrist, he
kissed it very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Soft and strong&mdash;like yourself," said he.  Ottilie
said nothing, but looked at her white feet through
the transparent water.  She thought that in letting
him kiss her arm and feeling as though he had kissed
right through to her heart, she was exhibiting a
pitiful lack of strength.  Somerset looked at her
askance, uncertain.  For nothing in the world would
he have offended.
</p>

<p>
"Did you mind?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head and continued to look at her
feet.  Somerset felt a great happiness pulse through
him.
</p>

<p>
"If I gave you up," said he, "I should be the
poorest spirited dog that ever whined."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she said, putting her hand in his.  "Let
us think only of the present happiness."
</p>

<p>
They sat silent for a moment, contemplating the
little red-roofed town and Illerville-sur-Mer, which
nestled in greenery beyond the white sweep of the
beach, and the rococo hotels and the casino, whose
cupolas flashed gaudily in the morning sun.  From
the north-eastern end of the bay stretched a long
line of sheer white cliff as far as the eye could reach.
Towards the west it was bounded by a narrow headland
running far out to sea.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like a frivolous little Garden of Eden,"
said Somerset, "but I wish we could never set foot
in it again."
</p>

<p>
"Let us dive in and forget it," said Ottilie.
</p>

<p>
She slipped into the water.  Somerset stood on the
gunwale and dived.  When he came up and had
shaken the salt water from his nostrils, he joined her
in two or three strokes.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go round the point to the little beach the
other side."
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.  It would take a long time to swim
there, rest, and swim back.  Her absence might be
noticed.  But she felt reckless.  Let her drink this
hour of happiness to the full.  What mattered
anything that could follow?  She smiled assent, and they
struck out steadily for the point.  It was good to
have the salt smell and the taste of the brine and the
pleasant smart of the eyes; and to feel their mastery
of the sea.  As they threw out their flashing white
arms and topped each tiny wave they smiled in
exultation.  To them it seemed impossible that
anyone could drown.  For the buoyant hour they
were creatures of the element.  Now and then a
gull circled before them, looked at them unconcerned,
as if they were in some way his kindred, and swept
off into the distance.  A tired white butterfly
settled for a moment on Ottilie's head; then
light-heartedly fluttered away sea-wards to its doom.
They swam on and on, and they neared the point.
They slackened for a moment, and he brought his
face close to hers.
</p>

<p>
"If I said 'Let us swim on for ever and ever,'
would you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, looking deep into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
After a while they floated restfully.  The last
question and answer seemed to have brought them a
great peace.  They were conscious of little save the
mystery of the cloudless ether above their faces and
the infinite sea that murmured in their ears strange
harmonies of Love and Death&mdash;harmonies woven
from the human yearnings of every shore and the
hushed secrets of eternal time.  So close were they
bodily together that now and then hand touched
hand and limb brushed limb.  A happy stillness of
the soul spread its wings over them and they felt it
to be a consecration of their love.  Presently his
arm sought her, encircled her, brought her head on
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Rest a little," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
She closed her eyes, surrendered her innocent self
to the flooding rapture of the moment.  The horrors
that awaited her passed from her brain.  He had
come to the lonely child like a god out of heaven.
He had come to the frightened girl like a new terror.
He was by her side now, the man whom of all men
God had made to accomplish her womanhood and
to take all of soul and body, sense and brain that she
had to give.  Their salt lips met in a first kiss.
Words would have broken the spell of the enchantment
cast over them by the infinite spaces of sea and
sky.  They drifted on and on, the subtle,
subconscious movement of foot and hand keeping them
afloat.  The little Princess moved closer to him so
as to feel more secure around her the circling
pressure of his arm.  He laughed a man's short, exultant
laugh, and gripped her more tightly.  Never had he
felt his strength more sure.  His right arm and his
legs beat rhythmically and he felt the pulsation of
the measured strokes of his companion's feet and the
water swirled past his head, so that he knew they
were making way most swiftly.  Of exertion there
was no sense whatever.  He met her eyes fixed
through half-shut lids upon his face.  Her soft young
body melted into his.  He lost count of time and
space.  Now and then a little wave broke over their
faces, and they laughed and cleared the brine from
their mouths and drew more close together.
</p>

<p>
"If it wasn't for that," she whispered once, "I
could go to sleep."
</p>

<p>
Soon they felt the gentle rocking of the sea increase
and waves broke more often over them.  Somerset
was the first to note the change.  Loosening his
hold of Ottilie, he trod water and looked around.
To his amazement they were still abreast of the point,
but far out to sea.  He gazed at it uncomprehendingly
for an instant, and then a sudden recollection
smote him like a message of death.  They
had caught the edge of the current against which
swimmers were warned, and the current held them
in its grip and was sweeping them on while they
floated foolishly.  A swift glance at Ottilie showed
him that she too realized the peril.  With the
outcoming tide it was almost impossible to reach
the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Are you afraid?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "Not with you."
</p>

<p>
He scanned the land and the sea.  On the arc of
their horizon lay the black hull of a tramp steamer
going eastwards.  Far away to the west was a speck
of white and against the pale sky a film of smoke.
Landwards beyond the shimmering water stretched
the sunny bay of the casino.  Its gilt cupolas shot
tiny flames.  The green-topped point, its hither side
deep in shadow, reached out helplessly for them.
Somerset and Ottilie still paused, doing nothing
more than keeping themselves afloat, and they felt
the current drifting them ever seawards.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like death," he said gravely.  "Are
you afraid to die?"
</p>

<p>
Again Ottilie said, "Not with you."
</p>

<p>
He looked at the land, and he looked at the white
speck and the puff of smoke.  Then suddenly his
heart leaped with the thrilling inspiration of a wild
impossibility.
</p>

<p>
"Let us leave Illerville and France behind us.
Death is as certain either way."
</p>

<p>
The little Princess looked at him wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we going?"
</p>

<p>
"To England."
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere but Illerville," she said.
</p>

<p>
He struck out seawards, she followed.  Each saw
the other's face white and set.  They had current
and tide with them, they swam steadily,
undistressed.  After a silence she called to him.
</p>

<p>
"Vince, if we go to our kingdom under the sea,
you will take me down in your arms?"
</p>

<p>
"In a last kiss," he said.
</p>

<p>
He had heard (as who has not) of Love being
stronger than Death.  Now he knew its truth.
But he swore to himself a great oath that they should
not die.
</p>

<p>
"I shall take my princess to a better kingdom,"
he said later.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Presently he heard her breathing painfully.  She
could not hold out much longer.
</p>

<p>
"I will carry you," he said.
</p>

<p>
An expert swimmer, she knew the way to hold his
shoulders and leave his arms unimpeded.  The
contact of her light young form against his body
thrilled him and redoubled his strength.  He held
his head for a second high out of the water and turned
half round.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I am going to let you die&mdash;now?"
</p>

<p>
The white speck had grown into a white hull, and
Somerset was making across its track.  To do so he
must deflect slightly from the line of the current.
His great battle began.
</p>

<p>
He swam doggedly, steadily, husbanding his
strength.  If the vessel justified his first flash of
inspiration, and if he could reach her, he knew how
he should act.  As best he could, for it was no time
for speech, he told Ottilie his hopes.  He felt the
spray from her lips upon his cheek, as she said:
</p>

<p>
"It seems sinful to wish for greater happiness than
this."
</p>

<p>
After that there was utter silence between them.
At first he thought exultingly of Bernheim and the
Princess Rabomirski, and the rage of their wicked
hearts; of the future glorified by his little Princess
of the unconquerable soul: of the present's mystic
consummation of their marriage.  But gradually
mental concepts lost sharpness of definition.
Sensation began to merge itself into a half-consciousness
of stroke on stroke through the illimitable waste.
Despite the laughing morning sunshine, the sky
became dark and lowering.  The weight on his neck
grew heavier.  At first Ottilie had only rested her
arms.  Now her feet were as lead and sank behind
him; her clasp tightened about his shoulders.  He
struggled on through a welter of sea and mist.
Strange sounds sang in his ears, as if over them had
been clamped great sea-shells.  At each short breath
his throat gulped down bitter water.  A horrible
pain crept across his chest.  His limbs seemed
paralysed and yet he remained above the surface.
The benumbed brain wondered at the miracle....
</p>

<p>
The universe broke upon his vision as a blurred
mass of green and white.  He recognised it vaguely
as his kingdom beneath the sea, and as in a dream
he remembered his promise.  He slipped round.
His lips met Ottilie's.  His arms wound round about
her, and he sank, holding her tightly clasped.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Strange things happened.  He was pulled hither
and thither by sea monsters welcoming him to his
kingdom.  In a confused way he wondered that he
could breathe so freely in the depths of the ocean.
Unutterable happiness stole upon him.  The
Kingdom was <i>real</i>.  His sham Princess would be queen
in very truth.  But where was she?
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes and found himself lying on the
deck of a ship.  A couple of men were doing funny
things to his arms.  A rosy-faced man in white
ducks and a yachting cap stood over him with a glass
of brandy.  When he had drunk the spirit, the rosy
man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That was a narrow shave.  We got you just in
time.  We were nearly right on you.  The young
woman is doing well.  My wife is looking after her."
</p>

<p>
As soon as he could collect his faculties, Somerset
asked,
</p>

<p>
"Are you the <i>Mavis</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I felt sure of it.  Are you Sir Henry Ransome?"
</p>

<p>
"That's my name."
</p>

<p>
"I heard you were expected at Illerville to-day,"
said Somerset.  "That is why I made for you."
</p>

<p>
The two men who had been doing queer things
with his arms wrapped him in a blanket and propped
him up against the deck cabin.
</p>

<p>
"But what on earth were you two young people
doing in the middle of the English Channel?" asked
the owner of the <i>Mavis</i>.
</p>

<p>
"We were eloping," said Somerset.
</p>

<p>
The other looked at him for a bewildered moment
and burst into a roar of laughter.  He turned to the
cabin door and disappeared, to emerge a moment
afterwards followed by a lady in a morning wrapper.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Marian?  It's an elopement."
</p>

<p>
Somerset smiled at them.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever heard of the Princess Rabomirski?
You have?  Well, this is her daughter.
Perhaps you know of the Count Bernheim who is
always about with the Princess?"
</p>

<p>
"I trod on him last winter at Monte Carlo," said
Sir Henry Ransome.
</p>

<p>
"He survives," said Somerset, "and has bought
the Princess Ottilie from her mother.  He's not
going to get her.  She belongs to me.  My name is
Somerset, and I am foreign sub-editor of the <i>Daily
Post</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I am very pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Somerset," said Sir Henry with a smile.  "And
now what can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you can lend us some clothes and take us to
any part on earth save Illerville-sur-Mer, you will
earn our eternal gratitude."
</p>

<p>
Sir Henry looked doubtful.  "We have made our
arrangements for Illerville," said he.
</p>

<p>
His wife broke in.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't take these romantic beings straight
to Southampton, I'll never set my foot upon this
yacht again."
</p>

<p>
"It was you, my dear, who were crazy to come to
Illerville."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think," said Lady Ransome, "you
might provide Mr. Somerset with some dry things?"
</p>

<p>
Four hours afterwards Somerset sat on deck by
the side of Ottilie, who, warmly wrapped, lay on a
long chair.  He pointed to the far-away coastline of
the Isle of Wight.
</p>

<p>
"Behold our kingdom!" said he.
</p>

<p>
The little Princess laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That is not our kingdom."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is?"
</p>

<p>
"Just the little bit of space that contains both you
and me," she said.
</p>

<h3>
THE HEART AT TWENTY
</h3>

<p>
The girl stood at the end of the little stone
jetty, her hair and the ends of her cheap fur
boa and her skirts all fluttering behind her
in the stiff north-east gale.  Why anyone should
choose to stand on a jetty on a raw December
afternoon with the wind in one's teeth was a difficult
problem for a comfort-loving, elderly man like myself,
and I pondered over it as I descended the slope
leading from the village to the sea.  It was nothing,
thought I, but youth's animal delight in physical
things.  A few steps, however, brought me in view
of her face in half-profile, and I saw that she did not
notice wind or spray, but was staring out to sea with
an intolerable wistfulness.  A quick turn in the path
made me lose the profile.  I crossed the road that
ran along the shore and walked rapidly along the
jetty.  Arriving within hailing distance I called her.
</p>

<p>
"Pauline."
</p>

<p>
She pivoted round like a weather-cock in a gust
and with a sharp cry leaped forward to meet me.
Her face was aflame with great hope and joy.  I
have seen to my gladness that expression once before
worn by a woman.  But as soon as this one
recognised me, the joy vanished, killed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's you," she said, with a quivering lip.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, my dear," said I, taking her hand.
"I can't help it.  I wish from my heart I were
somebody else."
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears.  I put my arm around her and
drew her to me, and patted her and said "There,
there!" in the blundering masculine way.  Having
helped to bring her into the world twenty years
before, I could claim fatherly privileges.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Doctor," she sobbed, dabbing her pretty
young eyes with a handkerchief.  "Do forgive me.
Of course I am glad to see you.  It was the shock.
I thought you were a ghost.  No one ever comes to
Ravetot."
</p>

<p>
"Never?" I asked mildly.
</p>

<p>
The tears flowed afresh.  I leaned against the
parapet of the jetty for comfort's sake, and looked
around me.  Ravetot-sur-Mer was not the place to
attract visitors in December.  A shingle beach with
a few fishing-boats hauled out of reach of the surf;
a miniature casino, like an impudently large
summer-house, shuttered-up, weather-beaten and desolate;
a weather-beaten, desolate, and shuttered-up Hôtel
de l'Univers, and a perky deserted villa or two on
the embankment; a cliff behind them, topped by a
little grey church; the road that led up the gorge
losing itself in the turn&mdash;and that was all that was
visible of Ravetot-sur-Mer.  A projecting cliff
bounded the bay at each side, and in front seethed
the grey, angry Channel.  It was an Aceldama of a
spot in winter; and only a matter of peculiar urgency
had brought me hither.  Pauline and her decrepit
rascal of a father were tied to Ravetot by sheer
poverty.  He owned a pretty villa half a mile
inland, and the rent he obtained for it during the
summer enabled them to live in some miraculous way the
rest of the year.  They, the Curé and the fisher-folk,
were the sole winter inhabitants of the place.  The
nearest doctor lived at Merville, twenty kilometres
away, and there was not even an educated farmer in
the neighbourhood.  Yet I could not help thinking
that my little friend's last remark was somewhat
disingenuous.
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure, my dear," I said, "that no
one ever comes to Ravetot?"
</p>

<p>
"Has father told you?" she asked tonelessly.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I guessed it.  I have extraordinary powers
of divination.  And the Somebody has been making
my little girl miserable."
</p>

<p>
"He has broken my heart," said Pauline.
</p>

<p>
I pulled the collar of my fur-lined coat above my
ears which the north-east wind was biting.  Being
elderly and heart-whole I am sensitive to cold.  I
proposed that we should walk up and down the jetty
while she told me her troubles, and I hooked her arm
in mine.
</p>

<p>
"Who was he?" I asked.  "And what was he
doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Doctor! what does it matter?" she answered
tearfully.  "I never want to see him again."
</p>

<p>
"Don't fib," said I.  "If the confounded blackguard
were here now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But he isn't a blackguard!" she flashed.  "If he
were I shouldn't be so miserable.  I should forget
him.  He is good and kind, and noble, and everything
that is right.  I couldn't have expected him
to act otherwise&mdash;it was awful, horrible&mdash;and
when you called me by name I thought it was he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the contradictious feminine did very much
want to see him?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," she confessed.
</p>

<p>
I looked down at her pretty face and saw that it
was wan and pinched.
</p>

<p>
"You have been eating little and sleeping less.
For how long?" I demanded sternly.
</p>

<p>
"For a week," she said pitifully.
</p>

<p>
"We must change all that.  This abominable hole
is a kind of cold storage for depression."
</p>

<p>
She drew my arm tighter.  She had always been an
affectionate little girl, and now she seemed to crave
human sympathy and companionship.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind it now.  It doesn't in the least
matter where I am.  Before he came I used to hate
Ravetot, and long for the gaiety and brightness of
the great world.  I used to stand here for hours and
just long and long for something to happen to take
us away; and it seemed no good.  Here I was for
the rest of time&mdash;with nothing to do day after day
but housework and sewing and reading, while father
sat by the fire, with his little roulette machine and
Monte Carlo averages and paper and pencil, working
out the wonderful system that is going to make our
fortune.  We'll never have enough money to go to
Monte Carlo for him to try it, so that is some
comfort.  One would have thought he had had enough
of gambling."
</p>

<p>
She made the allusion, very simply, to me&mdash;an old
friend.  Her father had gambled away a fortune,
and in desperation had forged another man's name
on the back of a bill, for which he had suffered a term
of imprisonment.  His relatives had cast him out.
That was why he lived in poverty-stricken seclusion
at Ravetot-sur-Mer.  He was not an estimable old
man, and I had always pitied Pauline for being so
parented.  Her mother had died years ago.  I
thought I would avoid the painful topic.
</p>

<p>
"And so," said I, after we had gone the length of
the jetty in silence and had turned again, "one day
when the lonely little princess was staring out to sea
and longing for she knew not what, the young prince
out of the fairy tale came riding up behind her&mdash;and
stayed just long enough to make her lose her
heart&mdash;and then rode off again."
</p>

<p>
"Something like it&mdash;only worse," she murmured.
And then, with a sudden break in her voice, "I will
tell you all about it.  I shall go mad if I don't.  I
haven't a soul in the world to speak to.  Yes.  He
came.  He found me standing at the end of the jetty.
He asked his way, in French, to the cemetery, and I
recognised from his accent that he was English like
myself.  I asked him why he wanted to go to the
cemetery.  He said that it was to see his wife's
grave.  The only Englishwoman buried here was a
Mrs. Everest, who was drowned last summer.  This
was the husband.  He explained that he was in the
Indian Civil Service, was now on leave.  Being in Paris
he thought he would like to come to Ravetot, where
he could have quiet, in order to write a book."
</p>

<p>
"I understood it was to see his wife's grave," I
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"He wanted to do that as well.  You see, they had
been separated for some years&mdash;judicially separated.
She was not a nice woman.  He didn't tell
me so; he was too chivalrous a gentleman.  But I
had learned about her from the gossip of the place.
I walked with him to the cemetery.  I know a
well-brought-up girl wouldn't have gone off like that with
a stranger."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said I, "in Ravetot-sur-Mer she would
have gone off with a hippogriffin."
</p>

<p>
She pressed my arm.  "How understanding you
are, doctor, dear."
</p>

<p>
"I have an inkling of the laws that govern
humanity," I replied.  "Well, and after the pleasant
trip to the cemetery?"
</p>

<p>
"He asked me whether the café at the top of the
hill was really the only place to stay at in Ravetot.
It's dreadful, you know&mdash;no one goes there but
fishermen and farm labourers&mdash;and it is the only
place.  The hotel is shut up out of the season.  I
said that Ravetot didn't encourage visitors during
the winter.  He looked disappointed, and said that
he would have to find quiet somewhere else.  Then
he asked whether there wasn't any house that would
take him in as a boarder?"
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doctor, he seemed so strong and kind, and his
eyes were so frank.  I knew he was everything that a
man ought to be.  We were friends at once, and I
hated the thought of losing him.  It is not gay at
Ravetot with only Jeanne to talk to from week's end
to week's end.  And then we are so poor&mdash;and you
know we do take in paying guests when we can get them."
</p>

<p>
"I understand perfectly," said I.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  That was how it happened.  Would
a nice girl have done such a thing?  I replied that if
she knew as much of the ways of nice girls as I did,
she would be astounded.  She smiled wanly and
went on with her artless story.  Of course Mr. Everest
jumped at the suggestion.  It is not given to
every young and unlamenting widower to be housed
beneath the same roof with so delicious a young
woman as Pauline.  He brought his luggage and took
possession of the best spare room in the Villa, while
Pauline and old, slatternly Jeanne, the <i>bonne à tout
faire</i>, went about with agitated minds and busy
hands attending to his comfort.  Old Widdrington,
however, in his morose chimney-corner, did not
welcome the visitor.  He growled and grumbled
and rated his daughter for not having doubled the
terms.  Didn't she know they wanted every penny
they could get?  Something was wrong with his
roulette machine which ought to be sent to Paris for
repairs.  Where was the money to come from?  Pauline's
father is the most unscrupulous, selfish old
curmudgeon of my acquaintance!
</p>

<p>
Then, according to my young lady's incoherent and
parenthetic narrative, followed idyllic days.  Pauline
chattered to Mr. Everest in the morning, walked with
him in the afternoon, pretended to play the piano to
him in the evening, and in between times sat with
him at meals.  The inevitable happened.  She had
met no one like him before&mdash;he represented the
strength and the music of the great world.  He
flashed upon her as the realisation of the vague
visions that had floated before her eyes when she
stared seawards in the driving wind.  That the man
was a bit in love with her seems certain.  I think
that one day, when a wayside shed was sheltering
them from the rain, he must have kissed her.  A
young girl's confidences are full of details; but the
important ones are generally left out.  They can be
divined, however, by the old and experienced.  At
any rate Pauline was radiantly happy, and Everest
appeared contented to stay indefinitely at Ravetot
and watch her happiness.
</p>

<p>
Thus far the story was ordinary enough.  Given
the circumstances it would have been extraordinary
if my poor little Pauline had not fallen in love with
the man and if the man's heart had not been touched.
If he had found the girl's feelings too deep for his
response and had precipitately bolted from a
confused sense of acting honourably towards her, the
story would also have been commonplace.  The
cause of his sudden riding away was peculiarly
painful.  Somehow I cannot blame him; and yet I am
vain enough to imagine that I should have acted
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
One morning Everest asked her if Jeanne might
search his bedroom for a twenty-franc piece which
he must have dropped on the floor.  In the afternoon
her father gave her twenty francs to get a postal
order; he was sending to Paris for some fresh
mechanism for his precious roulette-wheel.  Everest
accompanied her to the little Post Office.  They
walked arm in arm through the village like an
affianced couple, and I fancy he must have said
tenderer things than usual on the way, for at this stage
of the story she wept.  When she laid the louis on
the stab below the <i>guichet</i>, she noticed that it was a
a new Spanish coin.  Spanish gold is rare.  She
showed it to Everest, and meeting his eyes read in
them a curious questioning.  The money order
obtained, they continued their walk happily, and
Pauline forgot the incident.  Some days passed.
Everest grew troubled and preoccupied.  One
live-long day he avoided her society altogether.  She
lived through it in a distressed wonder, and cried
herself to sleep that night.  How had she offended?
The next morning he gravely announced his
departure.  Urgent affairs summoned him to Paris.
In dazed misery she accepted the payment of his
account and wrote him a receipt.  His face was set
like a mask, and he looked at her out of cold, stern
eyes which frightened her.  In a timid way she
asked him if he were going without one kind word.
</p>

<p>
"There are times, Miss Widdrington," said he
"when no word at all is the kindest."
</p>

<p>
"But what have I done?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all but what is good and right.  You
may think whatever you like of me.  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
He grasped his Gladstone bag, and through the
window she saw him give it to the fisher-lad who was
to carry it three miles to the nearest wayside station.
He disappeared through the gate, and so out of her
life.  Fat, slatternly Jeanne came upon her a few
moments later moaning her heart out, and administered
comfort.  It is very hard for Mademoiselle&mdash;but
what could Mademoiselle expect?  Monsieur
Everest could not stay any longer in the house.
Naturally.  Of course, Monsieur was a little touched
in the brain, with his eternal calculations&mdash;he was
not responsible for his actions.  Still, Monsieur
Everest did not like Monsieur to take money out of
his room.  But, Great God of Pity! did not
Mademoiselle know that was the reason of Monsieur
Everest going away?
</p>

<p>
"It was father who had stolen the Spanish louis,"
cried Pauline in a passion of tears, as we leaned once
more against the parapet of the jetty.  "He also
stole a fifty-franc note.  Then he was caught
red-handed by Mr. Everest rifling his despatch-box.
Jeanne overheard them talking.  It is horrible,
horrible!  How he must despise me!  I feel wrapped
in flames when I think of it&mdash;and I love him so&mdash;and
I haven't slept for a week&mdash;and my heart is
broken."
</p>

<p>
I could do little to soothe this paroxysm, save let it
spend itself against my great-coat, while I again put
my arm around her.  The grey tide was leaping in
and the fine spray dashed in my face.  The early
twilight began to settle over Ravetot, which
appeared more desolate than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, my dear," said I, "you are young,
and as your soul is sweet and clean you will get over
this."
</p>

<p>
"Never," she moaned.
</p>

<p>
"You will leave Ravetot-sur-Mer and all its associations,
and the brightness of life will drive all the
shadows away."
</p>

<p>
"No.  It is impossible.  My heart is broken and I
only want to stay here at the end of the jetty until
I die."
</p>

<p>
"I shall die, anyhow," I remarked with a shiver,
"if I stay here much longer, and I don't want to.
Let us go home."
</p>

<p>
She assented.  We walked away from the sea and
struck the gloomy inland road.  Then I said,
somewhat meaningly:
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you the curiosity to enquire why I left
my comfortable house in London to come to this
God-forsaken hole?"
</p>

<p>
"Why did you, Doctor, dear?" she asked listlessly.
</p>

<p>
"To inform you that your cross old aunt Caroline
is dead, that she has left you three thousand pounds a
year under my trusteeship till you are five-and-twenty,
and that I am going to carry off the rich and
beautiful Miss Pauline Widdrington to England
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
She stood stock-still looking at me open-mouthed.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said I.
</p>

<p>
Her face was transfigured with a sudden radiance.
Amazement, rapture, youth&mdash;the pulsating wonder
of her twenty years danced in her eyes.  In her
excitement she pulled me by the lapels of my coat&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Doctor</i>!  DOCTOR!  Three thousand pounds a
year!  England!  London!  Men and women!
Everything I've longed for!  All the glad and
beautiful things of life!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear."
</p>

<p>
She took my hands and swung them backwards and
forwards.
</p>

<p>
"It's Heaven!  Delicious Heaven!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"But what about the broken heart?" I said
maliciously.
</p>

<p>
She dropped my hands, sighed, and her face
suddenly assumed an expression of portentous misery.
</p>

<p>
"I was forgetting.  What does anything matter
now?  I shall never get over it.  My heart <i>is</i>
broken."
</p>

<p>
"Devil a bit, my dear," said I.
</p>

<h3>
THE SCOURGE
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
Up to the death of his wife, that is to say for
fifty-six years, Sir Hildebrand Oates held
himself to be a very important and upright
man, whose life not only was unassailable by slander,
but even through the divine ordering of his being
exempt from criticism.  To the world and to himself
he represented the incarnation of British impeccability,
faultless from the little pink crown of his head
to the tips of his toes correctly pedicured and
unstained by purples of retributive gout.  Except in
church, where a conventional humility of attitude
is imposed, his mind was blandly <i>conscia recti</i>.  No
ghost of sins committed disturbed his slumbers.
He had committed no sin.  He could tick off the
Ten Commandments one by one with a serene
conscience.  He objected to profane swearing; he was
a strict Sabbatarian; he had honoured his father
and his mother and had erected a monument over
their grave which added another fear of death to
the beholder; he neither thieved nor murdered, nor
followed in the footsteps of Don Juan, nor in those
of his own infamous namesake; and being blessed
in the world's goods, coveted nothing possessed by
his neighbour&mdash;not even his wife, for his neighbours'
wives could not compare in wifely meekness with
his own.  In thought, too, he had not sinned.  Never,
so far as he remembered, had he spoken a ribald
word, never, indeed had he laughed at an unsavoury
jest.  It may be questioned whether he had laughed
at any kind of joke whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
Sir Hildebrand stood for many things: for Public
Morality; his name appeared on the committees of
all the societies for the suppression of all the vices:
for sound Liberalism and Incorruptible Government;
he had poured much of his fortune into the party
coffers and, to his astonishment, a gracious (and
minister-harrassed) Sovereign had conveyed recognition
of his virtues in the form of a knighthood.
For the sacred rights of the people; as Justice of the
Peace he sentenced vagrants who slept in other
people's barns to the severest penalties.  For
Principle in private life; in spite of the rending of his
own heart and the agonized tears of his wife, he had
cast off his undutiful children, a son and a daughter
who had been guilty of the sin of disobedience and
had run away taking their creaking destinies in their
own hands.  For the Sanctity of Home Life; night
and morning he read prayers before the assembled
household and dismissed any maidservant who
committed the impropriety of conversing with a villager
of the opposite sex.  From youth up, his demeanour
had been studiously grave and punctiliously courteous.
A man of birth and breeding, he made it his
ambition to be what he, with narrow definition,
termed "a gentleman of the old school"; but being
of Whig lineage, he had sat in Parliament as an
hereditary Liberal and believed in Progressive
Institutions.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to give a flashlight picture of a human
being at once so simple and so complex.  An ardent
Pharisee may serve as an epigrammatic characterisation.
Hypocrite he was not.  No miserable sinner
more convinced of his rectitude, more devoid of
pretence, ever walked the earth.  Though his
narrowness of view earned him but little love from his
fellow-humans, his singleness of purpose, aided by
an ample fortune, gained a measure of their respect.
He lived irreproachably up to his standards.  In an
age of general scepticism he had unshakable faith.
He believed intensely in himself.  Now this
passionate certitude of infallibility found, as far as his
life's drama is concerned, its supreme expression in
his relation to his wife, his children, and his money.
</p>

<p>
He married young.  His wife brought him a
fortune for which he was sole trustee, a couple of
children, and a submissive obedience unparalleled
in the most correct of Moslem households.  Eresby
Manor, where they had lived for thirty years, was
her own individual property, and she drew for pocket
money some five hundred pounds a year.  A timid,
weak, sentimental soul, she was daunted from the
first few frosty days of honeymoon by the inflexible
personality of her husband.  For thirty years she
passed in the world's eye for little else than his
shadow.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you must allow me to judge in such
matters," he would say in reply to mild remonstrance.
And she deferred invariably to his judgment.  When
his son Godfrey and his daughter Sybil went their
respective unfilial ways, it was enough for him to
remark with cold eyes and slight, expressive gesture:
</p>

<p>
"My dear, distressing as I know it is to you, their
conduct has broken my heart and I forbid the
mention of their names in this house."
</p>

<p>
And the years passed and the perfect wife, though,
in secret, she may have mourned like Rachel for her
children, obeyed the very letter of her husband's law.
</p>

<p>
There remains the third vital point, to which I
must refer, if I am to make comprehensible the
strange story of Sir Hildebrand Oates.  It was
money&mdash;or, more explicitly, the diabolical caprice
of finance&mdash;that first shook Sir Hildebrand's faith,
not, perhaps, in his own infallibility, but in the
harmonious co-operation of Divine Providence and
himself.  For the four or five years preceding his
wife's death his unerring instinct in financial affairs
failed him.  Speculations that promised indubitably
the golden fruit of the Hesperides produced
nothing but Dead Sea apples.  He lost enormous
sums of money.  Irritability constricted both his
brow and the old debonair "s" at the end of his
signature.  And when the County Guarantee
Investment Society of which he was one of the original
founders and directors called up unpaid balance on
shares, and even then hovered on the verge of scandalous
liquidation, Sir Hildebrand found himself racked
with indignant anxiety.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting at a paper-strewn table in his
library, a decorous library, a gentleman's library,
lined from floor to ceiling with bookcases filled with
books that no gentleman's library should be without,
and trying to solve the eternal problem why two
and two should not make forty, when the butler
entered announcing the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Thompson, glad to see you.  What is it?
Have you looked at Lady Oates?  Been a bit queer
for some days.  These east winds.  I hold them
responsible for half the sickness of the county."
</p>

<p>
He threw up an accusing hand.  If the east wind
had been a human vagabond brought before Sir
Hildebrand Oates, Justice of the Peace, it would have
whined itself into a Zephyr.  Sir Hildebrand's eyes
looked blue and cold at offenders.  From a stature of
medium height he managed to extract the dignity of
six-foot-two.  Beneath a very long and very straight
nose a grizzling moustache, dependent on the muscles
of the thin lips as to whether it should go up or down,
symbolised, as it were, the scales of justice.  Sketches
of accurately trimmed grey whiskers also indicated
the exact balance of his mind.  But to show that he
was human and not impassionately divine, his thin
hair once black, now greenish, was parted low down
on the left side and brought straight over, leaving the
little pink crown to which I have before alluded.  His
complexion was florid, disavowing atrabiliar prejudice.
He had the long blunted chin of those secure
of their destiny.  He was extraordinarily clean.
</p>

<p>
The doctor said abruptly: "It's nothing to do with
east winds.  It's internal complications.  I have to
tell you she's very seriously ill."
</p>

<p>
A shadow of impatience passed over Sir Hildebrand's brow.
</p>

<p>
"Just like my wife," said he, "to fall ill, when I'm
already half off my head with worry."
</p>

<p>
"The County Guarantee&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Hildebrand nodded.  The misfortunes of the
Society were public property, and public too, within
the fairly wide area of his acquaintance, was the
knowledge of the fact that Sir Hildebrand was
heavily involved therein.  Too often had he vaunted
the beneficent prosperity of the concern to which he
had given his august support.  At his own
dinner-table men had dreaded the half-hour after the
departure of the ladies, and at his club men had
fled from him as they flee from the Baconian
mythologist.
</p>

<p>
"It is a worry," the doctor admitted.  "But
financial preoccupations must give way"&mdash;he looked
Sir Hildebrand clear in the eyes&mdash;"must give way
before elementary questions of life and death."
</p>

<p>
"Death?"  Sir Hildebrand regarded him blankly.
How dare Death intrude in so unmannerly a fashion
across his threshold?
</p>

<p>
"I should have been called in weeks ago," said the
doctor.  "All I can suggest now is that you should
get Sir Almeric Home down from London.  I'll
telephone at once, with your authority.  An
operation may save her."
</p>

<p>
"By all means.  But tell me&mdash;I had no idea&mdash;I
wanted to send for you last week, but she's so
obstinate&mdash;said it was mere indigestion."
</p>

<p>
"You should have sent for me all the same."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," said Sir Hildebrand, "tell me the worst."
</p>

<p>
The doctor told him and departed.  Sir Hildebrand
walked up and down his library, a man undeservedly
stricken.  The butler entered.  Pringle,
the chauffeur, desired audience.
</p>

<p>
Admitted, the man plunged into woeful apology.
He had been trying the Mercédès on its return from
an overhaul, and as he turned the corner by
Rushworth Farm a motor lorry had run into him and
smashed his head-lamps.
</p>

<p>
"I told you when I engaged you," said Sir
Hildebrand, "that I allowed no accidents."
</p>

<p>
"It's only the lamps.  I was driving most careful.
The driver of the lorry owns himself in the wrong,"
pleaded the chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"The merits or demerits of the case," replied Sir
Hildebrand, "do not interest me.  It's an accident.
I don't allow accidents.  You take a month's
notice."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Sir Hildebrand, but I do think it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Enough," said Sir Hildebrand, dismissing him.
"I have nothing more to hear from you or to say to
you."
</p>

<p>
Then, when he was alone again, Sir Hildebrand
reflected that noble resignation under misfortune
was the part of a Christian gentleman, and in
chastened mood went upstairs to see his wife.  And
in the days that followed, when Sir Almeric Home,
summoned too late, had performed the useless
wonders of his magical craft and had gone, Sir
Hildebrand, most impeccable of husbands, visited
the sick-room twice a day, making the most correct
enquiries, beseeching her to name desires capable of
fulfilment, and urbanely prophesying speedy return
to health.  At the end of the second visit he bent
down and kissed her on the forehead.  The ukase
went forth to the servants' hall that no one should
speak above a whisper, for fear of disturbing her
ladyship, and the gardeners had orders to supply
the sick-room with a daily profusion of flowers.
Mortal gentleman could show no greater solicitude
for a sick wife&mdash;save perhaps bring her a bunch of
violets in his own hand.  But with an automatic
supply of orchids, why should he think of so trumpery
an offering?
</p>

<p>
Lady Oates died.  Sir Hildebrand accepted the
stroke with Christian resignation.  The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.  Yet his house was
desolate.  He appreciated her virtues, which were
many.  He went categorically through her
attributes: A faithful wife, a worthy mother of
unworthy children, a capable manager, a submissive
helpmate, a country gentlewoman of the old school
who provided supremely for her husband's material
comforts and never trespassed into the sphere of his
intellectual and other masculine activities.  His
grief at the loss of his Eliza was sincere.  The
impending crash of the County Guarantee Investment
Society ceased to trouble him.  His own fortune had
practically gone.  Let it go.  His dead wife's
remained&mdash;sufficient to maintain his position in the
county.  As Dr. Thompson had rightly said, the
vulgarities of finance must give way to the eternal
sublimities of death.  His wife, with whom he had
lived for thirty years in a conjugal felicity unclouded
save by the unforgivable sins of his children now
exiled through their own wilfulness to remote parts
of the Empire, was dead.  The stupendous fact
eclipsed all other facts in a fact-riveted universe.
Lady Oates who, after the way of women of limited
outlook, had always taken a great interest in funerals,
had the funeral of her life.  The Bishop of the
Diocese conducted the funeral service.  The County,
headed by the old Duke of Dunster, his neighbour,
followed her to the grave.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
"She was a good Christian woman, Haversham,"
said Sir Hildebrand later in the day.  "I did not
deserve her.  But I think I may feel that I did my
best all my life to ensure her happiness."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt, of course," replied Haversham, the
county lawyer.  "Er&mdash;don't you think we might
get this formal business over?  I've brought Lady
Oates's will in my pocket."
</p>

<p>
He drew out a sealed envelope.  Sir Hildebrand
held out his hand.  The lawyer shook his head.  "I'm
executor&mdash;it's written on the outside&mdash;I must
open it."
</p>

<p>
"You executor?  That's rather strange," said Sir
Hildebrand.
</p>

<p>
Haversham opened the envelope, adjusted his
glasses, and glanced through the document.  Then
he took off his glasses and his brows wrinkled, and
with a queer look, half scared, half malicious, in
his eyes, gazed at Sir Hildebrand.
</p>

<p>
"I must tell you, my dear Oates," said he, after a
moment or so, "that I had nothing to do with the
making of this.  Nothing whatsoever.  Lady Oates
called at my office about two years ago and placed
the sealed envelope in my charge.  I had no idea of
the contents till this minute."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see," said Sir Hildebrand; and again he
stretched out his hand.
</p>

<p>
Haversham, holding the paper, hesitated for a few
seconds.  "I'm afraid I must read it to you, there
being no third party present."
</p>

<p>
"Third party?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"A witness.  A formal precaution."  The lawyer
again put on his glasses.  "The introductory matter
is the ordinary phraseology of the printed form one
buys at stationers' shops&mdash;naming me executor."  Then
he read aloud:
</p>

<p>
"I will and bequeath to my husband, Sir Hildebrand
Oates, Knight, the sum of fifteen shillings to
buy himself a scourge to do penance for the arrogance,
uncharitableness and cruelty with which he has
treated myself and my beloved children for the last
thirty years.  I bequeath to my son Godfrey the
house and estate of Eresby Manor and all the furniture,
plate, jewels, livestock and everything of mine
comprised therein.  The residue of my possessions
I bequeath to my son Godfrey and my daughter
Sybil, in equal shares.  I leave it to my children to
act generously by my old servants, and my horses
and dogs."
</p>

<p>
Sir Hildebrand's florid face grew purple.  He
looked fishy-eyed and open-mouthed at the lawyer,
and gurgled horribly in his throat.  Haversham
hastily rang a bell.  The butler appeared.  Between
them they carried Sir Hildebrand up to bed and sent
for the doctor.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
When Sir Hildebrand recovered, which he did
quickly, he went about like a man in a daze, stupified
by his wife's hideous accusation and monstrous
ingratitude.  It was inconceivable that the submissive
angel with whom he had lived and the secret writer
of those appalling words should be one and the same
person.  Surely, insanity.  That invalidated the will.
But Haversham pointed out that insanity would
have to be proved, which was impossible.  The will
contained no legal flaw.  Lady Oates's dispositions
would have to be carried out.
</p>

<p>
"It leaves me practically a pauper," said Sir
Hildebrand, whereat the other, imperceptibly,
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He realised, in cold terror, that the house wherein
he dwelt was his no longer.  Even the chairs and
tables belonged to his son, Godfrey.  His own
personal belongings could be carried away in a
couple of handcarts.  Instead of thousands his
income had suddenly dwindled to a salvage of a few
hundreds a year.  From his position in the county
he had tumbled with the suddenness and irreparability
of Humpty-Dumpty!  All the vanities of his
life sprang on him and choked him.  He was a
person of no importance whatever.  He gasped.
Had mere outside misfortune beset him, he doubtless
would have faced his downfall with the courage of a
gentleman of the old school.  His soul would have
been untouched.  But now it was stabbed, and with
an envenomed blade.  His wife had brought him
to bitter shame....  "Arrogance, uncharitableness,
cruelty."  The denunciation rang in his head
day and night.  He arrogant, uncharitable, cruel?
The charge staggered reason.  His indignant glance
sweeping backward through the years could see
nothing in his life but continuous humility, charity,
and kindness.  He had not deviated a hair's breath
from irreproachable standards of conduct.
Arrogant?  When Sybil, engaged in consequences of
his tender sagacity to a neighbouring magnate, a
widowed ironmaster, eloped, at dead of night on her
wedding eve, with a penniless subaltern in the
Indian Army, he suffered humiliation before the
countryside, with manly dignity.  No less humiliating
had been his position and no less resigned his
attitude when Godfrey, declining to obey the
tee-total, non-smoking, early-to-bed, early-to-breakfast
rules of the house, declining also to be ordained and
take up the living of Thereon in the gift of the Lady
of the Manor of Eresby, went off, in undutiful
passion, to Canada to pursue some godless and
precarious career.  Uncharitableness?  Cruelty?  His
children had defied him, and with callous barbarity
had cut all filial ties.  And his wife?  She had lived
in cotton-wool all her days.  It was she who had
been cruel&mdash;inconceivably malignant.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IV
</p>

<p>
Sir Hildebrand, after giving Haversham, the
lawyer, an account of his stewardship&mdash;in his wild
investments he had not imperilled a penny of his
wife's money&mdash;resigned his county appointments,
chairmanships and presidentships and memberships
of committees, went to London and took a room at
his club.  Rumour of his fallen fortunes spread
quickly.  He found himself neither shunned nor
snubbed, but not welcomed in the inner
smoke-room coterie before which, as a wealthy and
important county gentleman, he had been wont to lay
down the law.  No longer was he Sir Oracle.  Sensitive
to the subtle changes he attributed them to the
rank snobbery of his fellow-members.  No doubt he
was right.  The delicate point of snobbery that he
did not realise was the difference between the
degrees of sufferance accorded to the rich bore and the
poor bore.  In the eyes of the club, Sir Hildebrand
Oates was the poor bore.  He became freezingly
aware of a devastating loneliness.  In the meanwhile
his children had written the correctest of letters.
Deep grief for mother's death was the keynote of
each.  With regard to worldly matters, Sybil
confessed that the legacy made a revolution in her plans
for her children's future, but would not affect her
present movements, as she could not allow her
husband to abandon a career which promised to be
brilliant.  She would be home in a couple of years.
The son, Godfrey, welcomed the unexpected fortune.
The small business he had got together just needed
this capital to expand into gigantic proportions.  It
would be two or three years before he could leave it.
In the meantime, he hoped his father would not
dream of leaving Eresby Manor.  Neither son nor
daughter seemed to be aware of Sir Hildebrand's
impoverishment.  Also, neither of them expressed
sympathy for, or even alluded to, the grief that he
himself must be suffering.  The omission puzzled
him; for he had the lawyer's assurance that they
should remain ignorant, as far as lay in his power, of
the dreadful text of the will.  Did the omission arise
from doubt in their minds as to his love for their
mother and the genuineness of his sorrow at her
death?  To solve the riddle, Sir Hildebrand began
to think as he had never thought before.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p>
Arrogance, uncharitableness, and cruelty.  To
wife and children.  For thirty years.  Fifteen
shillings to buy a scourge wherewith to do penance.  He
could think of nothing else by day or night.  The
earth beneath his feet which he had deemed so
solid became a quagmire, so that he knew not where
to step.  And the serene air darkened.  The roots
of his being suffered cataclysm.  Either his wife had
been some mad monster in human form, or her
terrible indictment had some basis of truth.  The
man's soul writhed in the flame of the blazing words.
A scourge for penance.  Fifteen shillings to buy it
with.  In due course he received the ghastly cheque
from Haversham.  His first impulse was to tear it
to pieces; his second, to fold it up and put it in his
letter-case.  At the end of a business meeting with
Haversham a day or two later, he asked him point-blank:
</p>

<p>
"Why did you insult me by sending me the cheque
for fifteen shillings?"
</p>

<p>
"It was a legal formality with which I was bound
to comply."
</p>

<p>
"<i>De minimis non curet lex</i>," said Sir Hildebrand.
"No one pays barley-corn rent or farthing damages
or the shilling consideration in a contract.  Your
action implies malicious agreement with Lady Oates'
opinion of me."
</p>

<p>
He bent his head forward and looked at Haversham
with feverish intensity.  Haversham had old scores
to settle.  The importance, omniscience, perfection,
and condescending urbanity of Sir Hildebrand had
rasped his nerves for a quarter of a century.  If there
was one living man whom he hated whole-heartedly,
and over whose humiliation he rejoiced, it was Sir
Hildebrand Oates.  He yielded to the swift temptation.
He rose hastily and gathered up his papers.
</p>

<p>
"If you can find me a human creature in this
universe who doesn't share Lady Oates's opinion, I
will give him every penny I am worth."
</p>

<p>
He went out, and then overcome with remorse for
having kicked a fallen man, felt inclined to hang
himself.  But he knew that he had spoken truly.
Meanwhile Sir Hildebrand walked up and down the little
visitors' room at the club, where the interview had
taken place, passing his hand over his indeterminate
moustache and long blunt chin.  He felt neither
anger nor indignation&mdash;but rather the dazed
dismay of a prisoner to whom the judge deals a severer
sentence than he expected.  After a while he sat at
a small table and prepared to write a letter connected
with the business matters he had just discussed with
Haversham.  But the words would not come, his
brain was fogged; he went off into a reverie, and
awoke to find himself scribbling in arabesque,
"Fifteen shillings to buy a scourge."
</p>

<p>
After a solitary dinner at the club that evening he
discovered in a remote corner of the smoking-room, a
life-long acquaintance, an old schoolfellow, one
Colonel Bagot, reading a newspaper.  He approached.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Bagot."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Bagot raised his eyes from the paper,
nodded, and resumed his reading.  Sir Hildebrand
deliberately wheeled a chair to his side and sat
down.
</p>

<p>
"Can I have a word or two with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my dear fellow," Bagot replied,
putting down his paper.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a boy was I at school?"
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a ... what the deuce do you
mean?" asked the astonished colonel.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to tell me what kind of a boy I was,"
said Sir Hildebrand gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Just an ordinary chap."
</p>

<p>
"Would you have called me modest, generous, and
kind?"
</p>

<p>
"What in God's name are you driving at?" asked
the Colonel, twisting himself round on his chair.
</p>

<p>
"At your opinion of me.  Was I modest, generous,
and kind?  It's a vital question."
</p>

<p>
"It's a damned embarrassing one to put to a man
during the process of digestion.  Well, you know,
Oates, you always were a queer beggar.  If I had had
the summing up of you I should have said: 'Free
from vice.'"
</p>

<p>
"Negative."
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes&mdash;in a way&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You've answered me.  Now another.  Do you
think I treated my children badly?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Oates&mdash;oh, confound it!"  Angrily he
dusted himself free from the long ash that had fallen
from his cigar.  "I don't see why I should be asked
such a question."
</p>

<p>
"I do.  You've known me all your life.  I want
you to answer it frankly."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Bagot was stout, red, and choleric.  Sir
Hildebrand irritated him.  If he was looking for
trouble, he should have it.  "I think you treated
them abominably&mdash;there!" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Sir Hildebrand.
</p>

<p>
"What?" gasped Bagot.
</p>

<p>
"I said 'thank you.'  And lastly&mdash;you have had
many opportunities of judging&mdash;do you think I did
all in my power to make my wife happy?"
</p>

<p>
At first Bagot made a gesture of impatience.  His
position was both grotesque and intolerable.  Was
Oates going mad?  Answering the surmise, Sir
Hildebrand said:
</p>

<p>
"I'm aware my question is extraordinary, perhaps
outrageous; but I am quite sane.  Did she look
crushed, down-trodden, as though she were not
allowed to have a will of her own?"
</p>

<p>
It was impossible not to see that the man was in a
dry agony of earnestness.  Irritation and annoyance
fell like garments from Bagot's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You really want to get at the exact truth, as far
as I can give it you?"
</p>

<p>
"From the depth of my soul," said Sir Hildebrand.
</p>

<p>
"Then," answered Bagot, quite simply, "I'm sorry
to say unpleasant things.  But I think Lady Oates
led a dog's life&mdash;and so does everybody."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I wanted to be sure of," said Sir
Hildebrand, rising.  He bent his head courteously.
"Good night, Bagot," and he went away with dreary
dignity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
VI
</p>

<p>
A cloud settled on Sir Hildebrand's mind through
which he saw immediate things murkily.  He passed
days of unaccustomed loneliness and inaction.  He
walked the familiar streets of London like one in a
dream.  One afternoon he found himself gazing with
unspeculative eye into the window of a small Roman
Catholic Repository where crucifixes and statues of
the Virgin and Child and rosaries and religious books
and pictures were exposed for sale.  Until realisation
of the objects at which he had been staring dawned
upon his mind, he had not been aware of the nature
of the shop.  The shadow of a smile passed over his
face.  He entered.  An old man with a long white
beard was behind the counter.
</p>

<p>
"Do you keep scourges?" asked Sir Hildebrand.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," replied the old man, somewhat astonished.
</p>

<p>
"That's unfortunate&mdash;very unfortunate," said
Sir Hildebrand, regarding him dully.  "I'm in need
of one."
</p>

<p>
"Even among certain of the religious orders the
Discipline is forbidden nowadays," replied the old
man.
</p>

<p>
"Among certain others it is practised?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so."
</p>

<p>
"Then scourges are procurable.  I will ask you to
get one&mdash;or have one made according to religious
pattern.  I will pay fifteen shillings for it."
</p>

<p>
"It could not possibly cost that&mdash;a mere matter
of wood and string."
</p>

<p>
"I will pay neither more nor less," said Sir
Hildebrand, laying on the counter the cheque which he
had endorsed and his card.  "I&mdash;I have made a
vow.  It's a matter of conscience.  Kindly send it
to the club address."
</p>

<p>
He walked out of the shop somewhat lighter of
heart, his instinct for the scrupulous satisfied.  The
abominable cheque no longer burned through letter-case
and raiment and body and corroded his soul.
He had devoted the money to the purpose for which
it was ear-marked.  The precision was soothed.  In
puzzling darkness he had also taken an enormous
psychological stride.
</p>

<p>
The familiar club became unbearable, his
fellow-members abhorrent.  Friends and acquaintances
outside&mdash;and they were legion&mdash;who, taking pity
on his loneliness, sought him out and invited him to
their houses, he shunned in a curious terror.  He was
forever meeting them in the streets.  Behind their
masks of sympathy he read his wife's deadly
accusation and its confirmation which he had received
from Haversham and Bagot.  When the scourge
arrived&mdash;a business-like instrument in a cardboard
box&mdash;he sat for a long time in his club bedroom
drawing the knotted cords between his fingers, lost
in retrospective thought....  And suddenly a scene
flashed across his mind.  Venice.  The first days
of their honeymoon.  The sun-baked Renaissance
façade of a church in a Campo bounded by a canal
where their gondola lay waiting.  A tattered,
one-legged, be-crutched beggar holding out his hat
by the church door....  He, Hildebrand, stalked
majestically past, his wife following.  Near the
<i>fondamenta</i> he turned and discovered her in the act
of tendering from her purse a two-lire piece to the
beggar who had hobbled expectant in her wake.
Hildebrand interposed a hand; the shock accidentally
jerked the coin from hers.  It rolled.  The one-legged
beggar threw himself prone, in order to seize
it.  But it rolled into the canal.  An agony of
despair and supplication mounted from the
tatterdemalion's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hildebrand, give him another."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," he replied.  "It's immoral to
encourage mendicity."
</p>

<p>
She wept in the gondola.  He thought her silly,
and told her so.  They landed at the Molo and he
took her to drink chocolate at Florian's on the
Piazza.  She bent her meek head over the cup and
the tears fell into it.  A well-dressed Venetian couple
who sat at the next table stared at her, passed
remarks, and giggled outright with the ordinary and
exquisite Italian politeness.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Eliza," said Hildebrand, "if you can't
help being a victim to sickly sentimentality, at least,
as my wife, you must learn to control yourself in
public."
</p>

<p>
And meekly she controlled herself and drank her
salted chocolate.  In compliance with a timidly
expressed desire, and in order to show his forgiveness,
he escorted her into the open square, and like any
vulgar Cook's tourist bought her a paper cornet of
dried peas, wherewith, to his self-conscious
martyrdom, she fed the pigeons.  Seeing an old man some
way off do the same, she scattered a few grains along
the curled-up brim of her Leghorn hat; and presently,
so still she was and gracious, an iridescent
swarm enveloped her, eating from both hands
outstretched and encircling her head like a halo.  For
the moment she was the embodiment of innocent
happiness.  But Hildebrand thought her notoriously
absurd, and when he saw Lord and Lady Benham
approaching them from the Piazzetta, he stepped
forward and with an abrupt gesture sent the pigeons
scurrying away.  And she looked for the vanished
birds with much the same scared piteousness as the
one-legged beggar had looked for the lost two-lire
piece.
</p>

<p>
After thirty years the memory of that afternoon
flamed vivid, as he drew the strings of the idle scourge
between his fingers.  And then the puzzling darkness
overspread his mind.
</p>

<p>
After a while he replaced the scourge in the
cardboard box and summoned the club valet.
</p>

<p>
"Pack up all my things," said he.  "I am going
abroad to-morrow by the eleven o'clock train from
Victoria."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p>
Few English-speaking and, stranger still, few
German-speaking guests stay at the Albergo Tonelli
in Venice.  For one thing, it has not many rooms;
for another, it is far from the Grand Canal; and for
yet another, the fat proprietor Ettore Tonelli and his
fatter wife are too sluggish of body and brain to
worry about <i>forestieri</i> who have to be communicated
with in outlandish tongues, and, for their supposed
comfort, demand all sorts of exotic foolishness such
as baths, punctuality, and information as to the
whereabouts of fusty old pictures and the exact
tariff of gondolas.  The house was filled from year's
end to year's end with Italian commercial travellers;
and Ettore's ways and their ways corresponded to a
nicety.  The Albergo Tonelli was a little red-brick
fifteenth-century palazzo, its Lombardic crocketed
windows gaily picked out in white, and it dominated
the <i>campiello</i> wherein it was situated.  In the centre
of the tiny square was a marble well-head richly
carved, and by its side a pump from which the
inhabitants of the vague tumble-down circumambient
dwellings drew the water to wash the underlinen
which hung to dry from the windows.  A great
segment of the corner diagonally opposite the
Albergo was occupied by the bare and rudely swelling
brick apse of a seventeenth-century church.  Two
inconsiderable thoroughfares, <i>calle</i> five foot wide, lead
from the <i>campiello</i> to the wide world of Venice.
</p>

<p>
It was hither that Sir Hildebrand Oates, after a
week of nerve-shattering tumult at one of the great
Grand Canal hotels, and after horrified examination
of the question of balance of expenditure over
income, found his way through the kind offices of a
gondolier to whom he had promised twenty francs if
he could conduct him to the forgotten church, the
memorable scene of the adventure of the beggar and
the two-franc piece.  With unerring instinct the
gondolier had rowed him to Santa Maria Formosa, the
very spot.  Sir Hildebrand troubled himself neither
with the church nor the heart-easing wonder of
Palma Vecchio's Santa Barbara within, but, with
bent brow, traced the course of the lame beggar
from the step to the <i>fondamenta</i>, and the course of
the rolling coin from his Eliza's hand into the canal.
Then he paused for a few moments deep in thought,
and finally drew a two-lire piece from his pocket,
and, recrossing the Campo, handed it gravely to a
beggar-woman, the successor of the lame man, who
sat sunning herself on the spacious marble seat by
the side of the great door.  When he returned to the
hotel he gave the gondolier his colossal reward and
made a friend for life.  Giuseppe delighted at finding
an English gentleman who could converse readily hi
Italian&mdash;for Sir Hildebrand, a man of considerable
culture, possessed a working knowledge of three or
four European languages&mdash;expressed his gratitude
on subsequent excursions, by overflowing with
picturesque anecdote, both historical and personal.
A pathetic craving for intercourse with his kind and
the solace of obtaining it from one remote from his
social environment drew Sir Hildebrand into queer
sympathy with a genuine human being.  Giuseppe
treated him with a respectful familiarity which he
had never before encountered in a member of the
lower classes.  One afternoon, on the silent <i>lagune</i>
side of the Giudecca, turning round on his cushions,
he confided to the lean, bronzed, rhythmically
working figure standing behind him, something of the
puzzledom of his soul.  Guiseppe, in the practical
Italian way, interpreted the confidences as a desire
to escape from the tourist-agitated and fantastically
expensive quarters of the city into some unruffled
haven.  That evening he interviewed the second
cousin of his wife, the Signora Tonelli of the Albergo
of that name, and the next day Sir Hildebrand took
possession of the front room overlooking the <i>campiello</i>,
on the <i>piano nobile</i> or second floor of the hotel.
</p>

<p>
And here Sir Hildebrand Oates, Knight, once
Member of Parliament, Lord of the Manor, Chairman
of Quarter Sessions, Director of great companies,
orchid rival of His Grace the Duke of Dunster,
important and impeccable personage, the exact
temperature of whose bath water had been to a
trembling household a matter of as much vital concern as
the salvation of their own souls&mdash;entered upon a
life of queer discomfort, privation and humility.
For the first time in his life he experienced the
hugger-mugger makeshift of the bed-sitting room&mdash;a
chamber, too, cold and comfortless, with one scraggy
rug by the bedside to mitigate the rigour of an inlaid
floor looking like a galantine of veal, once the pride
of the palazzo, and meagrely furnished with the
barest objects of necessity, and these of monstrous
and incongruous ugliness; and he learned in the
redolent restaurant downstairs, the way to eat
spaghetti like a contented beast and the relish of
sour wine and the overrated importance of the
cleanliness of cutlery.  In his dignified acceptance
of surroundings that to him were squalid, he
manifested his essential breeding.  The correct courtesy
of his demeanour gained for the <i>illustrissimo signore
inglese</i> the wholehearted respect of the Signore and
Signora Tonelli.  And the famous scourge nailed
(symbolically) over his hard little bed procured him
a terrible reputation for piety in the <i>parrocchia</i>.
After a while, indeed, as soon as he had settled to his
new mode of living, the inveterate habit of punctilio
caused him, almost unconsciously, to fix by the clock
his day's routine.  Called at eight o'clock, a kind of
eight conjectured by the good-humoured, tousled
sloven of a chamber-maid, he dressed with
scrupulous care.  At nine he descended for his morning
coffee to the chill deserted restaurant&mdash;for all the
revolution in his existence he could not commit the
immorality of breakfasting in his bedroom.  At
half-past he regained his room, where, till eleven, he
wrote by the window overlooking the urchin-resonant
<i>campiello</i>.  Then with gloves and cane, to
outward appearance the immaculate, the impeccable
Sir Hildebrand Oates of Eresby Manor, he walked
through the narrow, twisting streets and over
bridges and across <i>campi</i> and <i>campiello</i> to the
Piazza San Marco.  As soon as he neared the
east-end of the great square, a seller of corn and peas
approached him, handed him a paper cornet, from
which Sir Hildebrand, with awful gravity, fed the
pigeons.  And the pigeons looked for him, too; and
they perched on his arms and his shoulders and even
on the crown of his Homburg hat, the brim of which
he had, by way of solemn rite, filled with grain, until
the gaunt, grey, unsmiling man was hidden in fluttering
iridescence.  And tourists and idlers used to come
every day and look at him, as at one of the sights of
Venice.  The supply finished, Sir Hildebrand went
to the Café Florian on the south of the Piazza and
ordering a <i>sirop</i> which he seldom drank, read the
<i>Corriere de la Sera</i>, until the midday gun sent the
pigeons whirring to their favourite cornices.  Then
Sir Hildebrand retraced his steps to the Albergo
Tonelli, lunched, read till three, wrote till five, and
again went out to take the air.  Dinner, half an
hour's courtly gossip in the cramped and smelly
apology for a lounge, with landlord or a commercial
traveller disinclined for theatre or music-hall, or the
absorbing amusement of Venice, walking in the
Piazza or along the Riva Schiavoni, and then to read
or write till bedtime.
</p>

<p>
No Englishman of any social position can stand
daily in the Piazza San Marco without now and then
coming across acquaintances, least of all a man of
such importance in his day as Sir Hildebrand Oates.
He accepted the greetings of chance-met friends with
courteous resignation.
</p>

<p>
"We're at the Hôtel de l'Europe.  Where are you
staying, Sir Hildebrand?"
</p>

<p>
"I live in Venice, I have made it my home.  You
see the birds accept me as one of themselves."
</p>

<p>
"You'll come and dine with us, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I should love to," Sir Hildebrand would reply;
"but for the next month or so I am overwhelmed
with work.  I'm so sorry.  If you have any time to
spare, and would like to get off the beaten track, let
me recommend you to wander through the Giudecca
on foot.  I hope Lady Elizabeth is well.  I'm so
glad.  Will you give her my kindest regards?
Good-bye."  And Sir Hildebrand would make his
irreproachable bow and take his leave.  No one
learned where he had made his home in Venice.
In fact, no one but Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son
knew his address.  He banked with them and they
forwarded his letters to the Albergo Tonelli.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that Sir Hildebrand occupied
much of his time in writing, and he himself declared
that he was overwhelmed with work.  He was indeed
engaged in an absorbing task of literary composition,
and his reference library consisted in thirty or forty
leather-covered volumes each fitted with a clasp and
lock, of which the key hung at the end of his
watch-chain; and every page of every volume was filled
with his own small, precise handwriting.  He made
slow progress, for the work demanded concentrated
thought and close reasoning.  The rumour of his
occupation having spread through the parrocchia,
he acquired, in addition to that of a pietist, the
reputation of an <i>erudito</i>.  He became the pride of the
<i>campiello</i>.  When he crossed the little square, the
inhabitants pointed him out to less fortunate
out-dwellers.  There was the great English noble who
had made vows of poverty, and gave himself the
Discipline and wrote wonderful works of Theology.
And men touched their hats and women saluted
shyly, and Sir Hildebrand punctiliously, and with
a queer pathetic gratitude, responded.  Even the
children gave him a "Buon giorno, Signore," and
smiled up into his face, unconscious of the pious
scholar he was supposed to be, and of the almighty
potentate that he had been.  Once, yielding to an
obscure though powerful instinct, he purchased in
the Merceria a packet of chocolates, and on entering
his <i>campiello</i> presented them, with stupendous
gravity concealing extreme embarrassment, to a
little gang of urchins.  Encouraged by a dazzling
success, he made it a rule to distribute sweetmeats
every Saturday morning to the children of the
<i>campiello</i>.  After a while he learned their names and
idiosyncrasies, and held solemn though kindly
speech with them, manifesting an interest in their
games and questioning them sympathetically as to
their scholastic attainments.  Sometimes gathering
from their talk a notion of the desperate poverty of
parents, he put a lire or two into grubby little fists,
in spite of a lifelong conviction of the immorality
of indiscriminate almsgiving; and dark, haggard
mothers blessed him, and stood in his way
to catch his smile.  All of which was pleasant,
though exceedingly puzzling to Sir Hildebrand Oates.
</p>

<p class="t3b">
VIII
</p>

<p>
Between two and three years after their mother's
death, Sir Hildebrand's son and daughter, who bore
each other a devoted affection and carried on a
constant correspondence, arranged to meet in England,
Godfrey travelling from Canada, Sybil, with her
children, from India.  The first thing they learned
(from Haversham, the lawyer) was the extent of their
father's financial ruin.  They knew&mdash;many kind
friends had told them&mdash;that he had had losses and
had retired from public life; but, living out of the
world, and accepting their childhood's tradition of
his incalculable wealth, they had taken it for granted
that he continued to lead a life of elegant luxury.
When Haversham, one of the few people who really
knew, informed them (with a revengeful smile) that
their father could not possibly have more than a
hundred or two a year, they were shocked to the
depths of their clean, matter-of-fact English souls.
The Great Panjandrum, arbiter of destinies, had
been brought low, was living in obscurity in Italy.
The pity of it!  As they interchanged glances the
same thought leaped into the eyes of each.
</p>

<p>
"We must look him up and see what can be done,"
said Godfrey.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, dear," said Sybil.
</p>

<p>
"I offered him the use of Eresby, but he was too
proud to take it."
</p>

<p>
"And I never offered him anything at all," said Sybil.
</p>

<p>
"I should advise you," said Haversham, "to leave
Sir Hildebrand alone."
</p>

<p>
Godfrey, a high-mettled young man and one who
was accustomed to arrive at his own decisions, and
moreover did not like Haversham, gripped his sister
by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever advice you give me, Mr. Haversham, I
will take just when I think it necessary."
</p>

<p>
"That is the attitude of most of my clients,"
replied Haversham drily, "whether it is a sound
attitude or not&mdash;&mdash;" he waved an expressive hand.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go and hunt him up, anyway," said Godfrey.
"If he's impossible, we can come back.  If he
isn't&mdash;so much the better.  What do you say, Sybil?"
</p>

<p>
Sybil said what he knew she would say.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Hildebrand's address is vague," remarked
Haversham.  "Cook's, Venice."
</p>

<p>
"What more, in Hades, do we want?" cried the
young man.
</p>

<p>
So, after Sybil had made arrangements for the safe
keeping of her offspring, and Godfrey and herself
had written to announce their coming, the pair set
out for Venice.
</p>

<p>
"We are very sorry, but we are unable to give you
Sir Hildebrand Oates's address," said Messrs. Thomas
Cook and Son.
</p>

<p>
Godfrey protested.  "We are his son and
daughter," he said, in effect.  "We have reason to
believe our father is living in poverty.  We have
written and he has not replied.  We must find him."
</p>

<p>
Identity established, Messrs. Thomas Cook and
Son disclosed the whereabouts of their customer.  A
gondola took brother and sister to the <i>Campo</i> facing
the west front of the church behind which lay the
<i>Campiello</i> where the hotel was situated.  Their
hearts sank low as they beheld the mildewed decay
of the Albergo Tonelli, lower as they entered the
cool, canal-smelling <i>trattoria</i>&mdash;or restaurant, the
main entrance to the Albergo.  Signore Tonelli
in shirt sleeves greeted them.  What was their
pleasure?
</p>

<p>
"Sir Hildebrand Oates?"
</p>

<p>
At first from his rapid and incomprehensible
Italian they could gather little else than the fact of
their father's absence from home.  After a while the
reiteration of the words <i>ospedale inglese</i> made an
impression on their minds.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Malade?</i>" asked Sybil, trying the only foreign
language with which she had a slight acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Si, si!</i>" cried Tonelli, delighted at eventual
understanding.
</p>

<p>
And then a Providence-sent bagman who spoke a
little English came out and interpreted.
</p>

<p>
The <i>illustrissimo signore</i> was ill.  A pneumonia.
He had stood to feed the pigeons in the rain, in the
northeast wind, and had contracted a chill.  When
they thought he was dying, they sent for the English
doctor who had attended him before for trifling
ailments, and unconscious he had been transported
to the English hospital in the Giudecca.  And there
he was now.  A thousand pities he should die.  The
dearest and most revered man.  The whole
neighbourhood who loved him was stricken with grief.
They prayed for him in the church, the signore and
signora could see it there, and vows and candles had
been made to the Virgin, the Blessed Mother, for he
too loved all children.  Signore Tonelli, joined by
this time by his wife, exaggerated perhaps in the
imaginative Italian way.  But every tone and gesture
sprang from deep sincerity.  Brother and sister
looked at each other in dumb wonder.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ecco, Elizabetta!</i>"  Tonelli, commanding the
doorway of the restaurant, summoned an elderly woman
from the pump by the well-head and discoursed
volubly.  She approached the young English couple
and also volubly discoursed.  The interpreter
interpreted.  They gained confirmation of the amazing
fact that, in this squalid, stone-flagged, rickety little
square, Sir Hildebrand had managed to make
himself beloved.  Childhood's memories rose within
them, half-caught, but haunting sayings of
servants and villagers which had impressed upon their
minds the detestation in which he was held in their
Somersetshire home.
</p>

<p>
Godfrey turned to his sister.  "Well, I'm damned,"
said he.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see his rooms," said Sybil.
</p>

<p>
The interpreter again interpreted.  The Tonellis
threw out their arms.  Of course they could visit the
apartment of the <i>illustrissimo signore</i>.  They were
led upstairs and ushered into the chill, dark
bed-sitting-room, as ascetic as a monk's cell, and both
gasped when they beheld the flagellum hanging from
its nail over the bed.  They requested privacy.
The Tonellis and the bagman-interpreter retired.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil's the meaning of it?" said Godfrey.
</p>

<p>
Sybil, kind-hearted, began to cry.  Something
strange and piteous, something elusive had happened.
The awful, poverty-stricken room chilled her blood,
and the sight of the venomous scourge froze it.  She
caught and held Godfrey's hand.  Had their father
gone over to Rome and turned ascetic?  They looked
bewildered around the room.  But no other sign,
crucifix, rosary, sacred picture, betokened the pious
convert.  They scanned the rough deal bookshelf.
A few dull volumes of English classics, a few works on
sociology in French and Italian, a flagrantly staring
red <i>Burke's Landed Gentry</i>, and that was practically
all the library.  Not one book of devotion was
visible, save the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer,
and a little vellum-covered Elzevir edition of Saint
Augustine's <i>Flammulæ Amoris</i>, which Godfrey
remembered from childhood on account of its quaint
wood-cuts.  They could see nothing indicative of
religious life but the flagellum over the bed&mdash;and
that seemed curiously new and unused.  Again they
looked around the bare characterless room,
characteristic only of its occupant by its scrupulous
tidiness; yet one object at last attracted their
attention.  On a deal writing-table by the window lay
a thick pile of manuscript.  Godfrey turned the
brown paper covering.  Standing together, brother
and sister read the astounding title-page:
</p>

<p>
"An enquiry into my wife's justification for the
following terms of her will:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'I will and bequeath to my husband, Sir Hildebrand
Oates, Knight, the sum of fifteen shillings to
buy himself a scourge to do penance for the
arrogance, uncharitableness and cruelty with which he
has treated myself and my beloved children for the
last thirty years.'
</p>

<p>
"This dispassionate enquiry I dedicate to my son
Godfrey and my daughter Sybil."
</p>

<p>
Brother and sister regarded each other with drawn
faces and mutually questioning eyes.
</p>

<p>
"We can't leave this lying about," said Godfrey.
And he tucked the manuscript under his arm.
</p>

<p>
The gondola took them through the narrow waterways
to the Grand Canal of the Giudecca, where, on
the Zattere side, all the wave-worn merchant shipping
of Venice and Trieste and Fiume and Genoa finds
momentary rest, and across to the low bridge-archway
of the canal cutting through the island, on the
side of which is Lady Layard's modest English
hospital.  Yes, said the matron, Sir Hildebrand was
there.  Pneumonia.  Getting on as well as could be
expected; but impossible to see him.  She would
telephone to their hotel in the morning.
</p>

<p>
That night, until dawn, Godfrey read the manuscript,
a document of soul-gripping interest.  It was
neither an <i>apologia pro vita sua</i>, nor a breast-beating
<i>peccavi</i> cry of confession; but a minute analysis of
every remembered incident in the relations between
his family and himself from the first pragmatical days
of his wedding journey.  And judicially he delivered
judgments in the terse, lucid French form.  "Whereas
I, etc., etc...." and "whereas my wife, etc.,
etc...."&mdash;setting forth and balancing the facts&mdash;"it
is my opinion that I acted arrogantly," or
"uncharitably," or "cruelly."  Now and again, though
rarely, the judgments went in his favour.  But
invariably the words were added: "I am willing,
however, in this case, to submit to the decision of any
arbitrator or court of appeal my children may think
it worth while to appoint."
</p>

<p>
The last words, scrawled shakily in pencil, were:
</p>

<p>
"I have not, to my great regret, been able to bring
this record up-to-date; but as I am very ill and, at
my age, may not recover, I feel it my duty to say that,
as far as my two years' painful examination into my
past life warrants my judgment, I am of the opinion
that my wife had ample justification for the terms she
employed regarding me in her will.  Furthermore, if,
as is probable, I should die of my illness, I should like
my children to know that long ere this I have deeply
desired in my loneliness to stretch out my arms to
them in affection and beg their forgiveness, but that
I have been prevented from so doing by the appalling
fear that, I being now very poor and they being very
rich, my overtures, considering the lack of affection I
have exhibited to them in the past might be
misinterpreted.  The British Consul here, who has
kindly consented to be my executor, will..."
</p>

<p>
And then strength had evidently failed him and he
could write no more.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Godfrey related to his sister
what he had read and gave her the manuscript to
read at her convenience; and together they went to
the hospital and obtained from the doctor his
somewhat pessimistic report; and then again they visited
the Albergo Tonelli and learned more of the strange,
stiff and benevolent life of Sir Hildebrand Oates.
Once more they mounted to the cold cheerless room
where their father had spent the past two years.
Godfrey unhooked the scourge from the nail.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" Sybil asked, her
eyes full of tears.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to burn the damned thing.  Whether
he lives or dies, the poor old chap's penance is at an
end.  By God! he has done enough."  He turned
upon her swiftly.  "You don't feel any resentment
against him now, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Resentment?"  Her voice broke on the word
and she cast herself on the hard little bed and sobbed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
IX
</p>

<p>
And so it came to pass that a new Sir Hildebrand
Oates, with a humble and a contrite heart, which we
are told the Lord doth not despise, came into
residence once more at Eresby Manor, agent for his son
and guardian of his daughter's children.  Godfrey
transferred his legal business from Haversham to a
younger practitioner in the neighbourhood to whom
Sir Hildebrand showed a stately deference.  And
every day, being a man of habit&mdash;instinctive habit
which no revolution of the soul can alter&mdash;he
visited his wife's grave in the little churchyard, a
stone's throw from the manor house, and in his fancy
a cloud of pigeons came iridescent, darkening the
air....
</p>

<p>
The County called, but he held himself aloof.  He
was no longer the all-important unassailable man.
He had come through many fires to a wisdom
undreamed of by the County.  Human love had touched
him with its simple angel wing&mdash;the love of son and
daughter, the love of the rude souls in the squalid
Venetian <i>Campiello</i>; and the patter of children's
feet, the soft and trusting touch of children's hands,
the glad welcome of children's voices, had brought
him back to the elemental wells of happiness.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, the butler entering the dining-room
with the announcement "His Grace, the Duke
of&mdash;&mdash;" gasped, unable to finish the title.  For there
was Sir Hildebrand Oates&mdash;younger at fifty-nine
than he was at thirty&mdash;lying prone on the hearthrug,
with a pair of flushed infants astride on the softer
portions of his back, using the once almighty man
as a being of little account.  Sir Hildebrand turned
his long chin and long nose up towards his visitor,
and there was a new smile in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, Duke," said he, "but you see, I can't get up."
</p>

<h3>
MY SHADOW FRIENDS
</h3>

<p>
My gentle readers have been good enough to
ask me what some of the folk whose
adventures I have from time to time described
have done in the Great War.  It is a large question,
for they are so many.  Most of them have done
things they never dreamed they would be called
upon to do.  Those that survived till 1914 have
worked, like the rest of the community in England
and France, according to their several capacities,
in the Holiest Crusade in the history of mankind.
</p>

<p>
Well, let me plunge at once into the midst of things.
</p>

<p>
About a year ago the great voice of Jaffery came
booming across my lawn.  He was a Lieutenant-Colonel,
and a D.S.O., and his great red beard had
gone.  The same, but yet a subtly different Jaffery.
Liosha was driving a motor-lorry in France.  He told
me she was having the time of her life.
</p>

<p>
I have heard, too, of my old friend Sir Marcus,
leaner than ever and clad in ill-fitting khaki, and
sitting in a dreary office in Havre with piles of
browny-yellow army forms before him, on which he
had checked packing-cases of bully-beef ever since
the war began.  And if you visit a certain hospital&mdash;in
Manchester of all places, so dislocating has
been the war&mdash;there you will still see Lady Ordeyne
(it always gives me a shock to think of Carlotta as
Lady Ordeyne) matronly and inefficient, but the
joy and delight of every wounded man.
</p>

<p>
And Septimus?  Did you not know that the Dix
gun was used at the front?  His great new invention,
the aero-tank, I regret to say, was looked on coldly
by the War Office.  Now that Peace has come he is
trying, so Brigadier-General Sir Clem Sypher tells
me, to adapt it to the intensive cultivation of whitebait.
</p>

<p>
And I have heard a few stories of others.  Here is
one told me by a French officer, one Colonel Girault.
The scene was a road bridge on the outskirts of the
zone of the armies.  His car had broken down
hopelessly, and with much profane language he swung to
the bridge-head.  The sentry saluted.  He was an
elderly Territorial with a ragged pair of canvas
trousers and a ragged old blue uniform coat and a
battered kepi and an ancient rifle.  A scarecrow of a
sentry, such as were seen on all the roads of France.
</p>

<p>
"How far is it to the village?"
</p>

<p>
"Two kilometres, <i>mon Colonel</i>."
</p>

<p>
There was something familiar in the voice and in
the dark, humorous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Say, <i>mon vieux</i>, what is your name?" asked
Colonel Girault.
</p>

<p>
"Gaston de Nérac, <i>mon Colonel</i>."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Connais pas</i>," murmured the Colonel, turning
away.
</p>

<p>
"Exalted rank makes Gigi Girault forget the
lessons of humility he learned in the Café Delphine."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Girault stood with mouth agape.  Then
he laughed and threw himself into the arms of the
dilapidated sentry.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!  It is true.  It is Paragot!"
</p>

<p>
Then afterwards: "And what can I do for you,
<i>mon vieux</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Paragot.  "The <i>bon Dieu</i> has
done everything.  He has allowed me to be a soldier
of France in my old age."
</p>

<p>
And Colonel Girault told me that he asked for
news of the little Asticot&mdash;a painter who ought by
now to be famous.  Paragot replied:
</p>

<p>
"He is over there, killing Boches for his old
master."
</p>

<p>
Do you remember Paul Savelli, the Fortunate
Youth?  He lived to see his dream of a great,
awakened England come true.  He fell leading his
men on a glorious day.  His Princess wears on her
nurse's uniform the Victoria Cross which he had
earned in that last heroic charge, but did not live
to wear.  And she walks serene and gracious,
teaching proud women how to mourn.
</p>

<p>
What of Quixtus?  He sacrificed his leisure to the
task of sitting in a dim room of the Foreign Office for
ten hours a day in front of masses of German
publications, and scheduling with his scientific method
and accuracy the German lies.  Clementina saw
him only on Sundays.  She turned her beautiful
house on the river into a maternity home for soldiers'
wives.  Tommy, the graceless, when last home on
leave, said that she was capable of murdering the
mothers so as to collar all the babies for herself.
And Clementina smiled as though acknowledging a
compliment.  "Once every few years you are quite
intelligent, Tommy," she replied.
</p>

<p>
I have heard, too, that Simon, who jested so with
life, and Lola of the maimed face, went out to a
Serbian hospital, and together won through the
horror of the retreat.  They are still out there,
sharing in Serbia's victory, and the work of Serbia's
reconstruction.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of the war, in Regent Street, I
was vehemently accosted by a little man wearing
the uniform of a French captain.  He had bright
eyes, and a clean shaven chin which for the moment
perplexed me, and a swaggering moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Just over for a few hours to see the wife and little
Jean."
</p>

<p>
"But," said I, "what are you doing in this kit?
You went out as a broken-down Territorial."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon cher ami</i>," he cried, straddling across the
pavement to the obstruction of traffic, and regarding
me mirthfully, "it is the greatest farce on the world.
Imagine me!  I, a broken-down Territorial, as you
call me, bearded a lion of a General of Division in his
den&mdash;and I came out a Captain.  Come into the
Café Royal and I'll tell you all about it."
</p>

<p>
His story I cannot set down here, but it is not the
least amazing of the joyous adventures of my friend
Aristide Pujol.
</p>

<p>
What Doggie and Jeanne did in the war, my gentle
readers know.  Their first child was born on the
glorious morning of November 11, 1918, amid the
pealing of bells and shouts of rejoicing.  When
Doggie crept into the Sacred Room of Wonderment,
he found the babe wrapped up in the Union Jack and
the Tricolour.  "There's only one name for him,"
whispered Jeanne with streaming eyes, "Victor!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To leave fantasy for the brutal fact.  You may
say these friends of mine are but shadows.  It is
true.  But shadows are not cast by nothingness.
These friends must live substantially and
corporeally, although in the flesh I have never met them.
Some strange and unguessed sun has cast their
shadows across my path.  I <i>know</i> that somewhere or
the other they have their actual habitation, and I
know that they have done the things I have above
recounted.  These shadows of things unseen are
real.  In fable lies essential truth.  These shadows
that now pass quivering before my eyes have
behind them great, pulsating embodiments of men and
women, in England and France, who have given up
their lives to the great work which is to cleanse the
foulness of the Central Empires of Europe, regenerate
humanity, and bring Freedom to God's beautiful
earth.

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
